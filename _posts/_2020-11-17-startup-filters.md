My notes on the different levels of a startup journey<!--more-->The startup game:

Start here: (You little startup rats 🐀)

1. Level 1 - The validation
- Team checks out
- Ball-park idea checks out

2. Level 2 - Product market fit
- Demand for product
- Product fulfils demand

3. Level 3 - Earn more than you spend
- Customers pay more than it cost to operate
- You earn enough to operate and scale

4. Level 4 - Idealism remains
- Idealism is key to innovating into the future
- you avoid becoming bureaucratic and stale

5. Level 5 - World domination
- You are not tempted to sell for a cool billion
- You get to make the world
