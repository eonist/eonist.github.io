My notes on product market fit <!--more-->

### Here is what most people think PMF is:
- Early signs of start-up success:
- founders being 100% focused on talking to customers & finding PMF
- rate of product releases
- founders obsessing about quality of first 10 team members
- how quickly founders fire 1st underperforming employee
- consistency of investor updates
- founders being 100% focused on talking to customers & finding PMF
- rate of product releases

### Here is what PMF really is:
- Nothing better than actual real numbers. So rate of first visits vs rate of usage numbers in google analytics. Page-views. Session length. Recurring visits etc.
