>"But everyone else has time for this why are you so important?"

Self-help books / blogs keep telling us to say no to stuff, and they tell us to validate what we say yes to. So why is it still so difficult to say no? No is good, it means your aware of your limitations and the finite resources you posses. In my opinion saying No is one of the strongest ways to optimise for asymmetric outcomes. Saying yes to everything under group pressure only results in symmetric base line results that anyone can achieve. Think of a sports car, a sports-car is optimised for speed and only that, a sports car says no to a lot of things to optimise winning the race. It says no to safety, no to legroom, air-condition, baby seats, the list goes on.

Yet when we say no, as employees or even as the co-founder of your own company. Your stigmatised, your not a game player, people start to doubt that you have what it takes. So many people sub-come to peer pressure and say yes to more than they can handle, and burn out. You become a family optimised 7 door sedan with all the bells and whistles. A baseline performer. Thats great, if that‚Äôs your goal. I'm pretty sure if your reading this blog post that is not your goal. So accept us for what we are, we trying to achieve asymmetric results. So when we say no, that doesn‚Äôt make us prima-donnas that only think about our selfs, we are actually thinking of the bottom-line of the company, or protecting the money investors has put into our startups.

We say no, because we have validated that the effort doesn‚Äôt match the outcome. That seemingly small effort has no or very low impact in winning the race. In fact, shifting focus runs the risk of loosing the race. As an subordinate you might not agree, but you likely don‚Äôt know the full picture or the inner workings of the particular sportscar. That 45min timeslot we said no to might seem low effort for you, but for the sportscar, that 45min effort can ruin the race. Sportscars often time their execution far ahead and need all the timed pitstops and oil changes they have planed for. Stopping to focus on something else and starting the engines again can be deadly, as the motor will have turned cold and might never start up in time to win the race. üèéüèÅ‚ú®
