### Build times:

You can enable a timer right within Xcodeâ€™s UI. This timer is not visible by default but if you run the following in the command line a time will be displayed each time you build your app.

`defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowBuildOperationDuration -bool YES`

After you have enabled the timer, you will see the time it takes to compile your app in the build status bar in Xcode.

ðŸ‘‰ Remember to clean your proj to show this build time ðŸ‘ˆ
