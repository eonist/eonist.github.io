My notes on **rebranding** <!--more--> There are many reasons to rebrand. A distinctive, effective one
comes from three magic ingredients: purpose, process, and people.

### Purpose
A rebrand must be intentional, done with clarity of purpose
and connected to the strategy and vision for the company.

### Process
While the rationale varies, the fundamental process is the same.

### People
> "Everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the mouth." - Tyson

Even the most finely tuned process is still only as good as the people
in it. A balance of insiders, outsiders, experts, and generalists yields
the greatest end product. Diversity over homogeneity every time.

## 1. Create the brief
Get clear on the purpose, the stakeholders involved, how decisions get made, and what is in and out of scope for the rebrand. Be sure to clearly state the outcomes you hope to achieve; any deliverables produced should be in service of them.

## 2. Understand the business
Become fluent in the context of the business and brand(s). Know the competitive landscape, the pressures facing the business, how money is made, how customers experience the brand, and what's been done in the past. **Don't try to be an expert**. Just do the homework and be **empathetic**.

## 3. Align on the problems to solve
Establish a shared view of the challenges facing the business and brand, why they exist, and the opportunities unlocked when those problems are solved. Not every problem can be addressed, so pick the few that matters most to your audience.

## 4. Search for inspiration
Go outside of your office, your category, your comfort zone, your budget, and time constraints. Create collages, quote boards, and other things that provoke, inspire, or excite you. Great work is seldom conceived and delivered exclusively within the four walls of an office.

## 5. Select a creative direction
Using both inspiration and business context, assemble a range of creative directions that visualize the "look and feel" of a new brand. This is meant to show different solutions to problems facing the brand. Creative directions are starting points, not answers.

## 6. Create multiple brand directions
Equipped with clarity on the creative direction that will guide the design of the brand, reimagine both it's visual and verbal expressions. Create only as many directions as are necessary to reflect meaningful trade-offs.

## 7. Select and prototype a single brand direction
Revise and finalize a single brand direction by applying it to relevant and current use cases for the brand (e.g., marketing campaign, sales deck, social media post). Totes have many uses, effectively vetting a visual design is not one of them.

## 8. Launch the new brand into the world
The launch of a new brand ties back to the purpose set at the start of the work. Make a big splash if that's what's required, or be subtle if the noisiness of change is disruptive. When launching, consider all the places and spaces your brand shows up: online, in-store, in-product, etc.

### Pro tips:
- You have a better chance of making something better if your immersed in the material.
- Create the logo for a niche core group. Keep going back to this niche core group. Dont, try to appeal broadly. Broad appeal will accept niche focus, when they are acclimated
