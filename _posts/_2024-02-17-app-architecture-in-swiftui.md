My notes on swiftui app architecture<!--more-->

1. App Entry Point: This is where your app starts.
2. App Struct: This is the main part of your app. It sets up the first screen and manages the app's events.
3. Scene: This is a single screen or window in your app.
4. SceneDelegate: This sets up the scenes in your app on iOS.
5. ContentView: This is the first screen that shows up in your app.
6. View: These are the parts of your screen, like buttons or labels.
7. Modifiers: These change how your views look and act.
8. Preview Provider: This lets you see your screens as you code them.
9. Data Models and State: These keep track of your app's data and changes to it.

In short, a SwiftUI app is made up of an app struct, scenes, views, modifiers, and data models. It's designed to be easy to use and write less code.
