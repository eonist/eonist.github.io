My notes on asymmetric oppertunities
  
- Chase asymmetric opportunities
- Make sure you don't become a commodity
- The commodity game is a race to the bottom
  
Asymetric leverage. If you look at all successful companies ever, you will see that in the begining they had some form of asymmetric leverage. a team, a market opportunity, a position that compounded etc etc
  
Validate to find asymmetric opportunities. Make interesting positions,
  
The market is a web of bubbles. If you only chase small bubbles you will lose.
Try to find a place in the web of bubbles where you can grow.
  
If you invest enough into an asymmetric opportunity. You can ride that for a long time. Even create tremendous value, that can fund new asymmetric opportunities later.
  
But you have to carve out the invest in the first place. Time or money. And that is the challenge. Also of course mapping out the asymetry. But that anyone can do. And then leverage that mapping to get time and money. To pursue the asymmetry.
