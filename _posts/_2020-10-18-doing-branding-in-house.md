So we decided to do the initial art-direction in-house, how hard could it be right? <!--more-->Do you really have to be a designer to recognize good design? Or is having an eye for design enough to sense your way forward.

## Some key take-aways:

- Good branding looks really sharp and professional
- Great branding hacks peoples head
- A good logo looks symmetric and works in any context
- A great logo becomes the marketing, app-design, web-design, advertising  

## The meaning behind
That's great, but your first logo doesn't need to be perfect. It's much more about the abstract behind what you represent. Forget the name that is you for a second. And write down keywords that represent what you are. Make a word cloud, and start from that. Put down 20 ish keywords that strongly represent you. Try to make connections between them. And explore the common meaning of pairs and triads of words. I guess this part is what agencies call name-development.

## Level up later
Now try to visualize how you can represent these ideas with symbolism or visual concepts. Then once you find your way, try to become the user, will the user enjoy our visual profile. Will they embrace it? The great thing about doing the initial art-direction in-house is that once it's defined, and the feedback is positive. You can now use illustrators and designers to try and level up your initial expression. In our case, we have a lot of room to grow into our identity. Illustrations, animation, a tighter logo down the line.

## Effort equals output
That's where this story ends. It's nothing more to it. To be honest all it takes is focusing hard over time, and putting in the effort. I think it took us 1-2 weeks to find our name and brand. But it was worth it.
