Notes on founder attributes<!--more-->

According to the global tech incubator Antler, a successful founder must possess the following attributes: grit, drive, and spike.

**Grit**
Grit is the passion and perseverance to achieve long-term and meaningful goals. It involves the ability to persist in something you feel passionate about and to persevere when faced with obstacles. Grit is also about perseverance, which means sticking with it and continuing to work hard even after experiencing difficulty or failure.

**Drive**  
 Motivation is defined as "the willingness to do something, or something that causes willingness," while drive is defined as "a planned effort to achieve something." Although both words are goal-oriented, they have significant differences in meaning.

**Spike**  
 To demonstrate a spike, a founder should show talent and attention to one or two main interests. This can help differentiate them from others and provide a unique value proposition.
