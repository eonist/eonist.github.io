My notes on adding github repo or organisation activities to a slack channel<!--more-->

### Setup
1. In slack write: `/github subscribe name-of-org name-of-repo`
2. Click a few yes, confirm, enter password
3. 🎉 Now you get all activities from github right into a slack channel

### Pro tip:
- Uninstall `/github unsubscribe name-of-org name-of-repo`
- For other cool github integrations: `/github help`
