Using simplicity to support various devices. <!--more-->  The idea is to avoid 3-4 column layout which has become very popular with mac applications. These layout types are nice, but ultimately has complexity problems. Both in terms of code and user experience. 

In any case, starting with a simple layout and scaling up to a more complex layout is much simpler than starting with a complex layout and simplifying it.

### Note:
The top bar icons needs to go to a bottom bar to easily accommodate fullscreen mode on the mac. This will also allow for similar layout design across devices. 

### 4: modes:
- Commits-list-view
- Repo-tree-list-view
- Statistics-view (daily,month,year commit counter)
- App-settings-view

 **The future:**  
 Improvements to the app will be subtle things, like a file-text-editor which will be accessible through Commit-view. Statistics-View may get a graph. Repo-view may get a built in file-browser. Maybe the Commit-view will get a quick-find feature by just start typing something. But the idea of a simple Git client for "the rest of us" will remain. Cognitively its a lot easier to reason about an 1-column app with a simple purpose, rather than strive for power-user-features.
