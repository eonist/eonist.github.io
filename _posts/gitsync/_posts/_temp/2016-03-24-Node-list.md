## NodeList
- a back Button, when you click back the last int in the depthIndex is removed
- the listView gets each sibling item in the current depth index
- when you click a listItem, the index of the item you clicked will be added to the depthIndex, and a new list will be created based on the current depthIndex

## TODO:
- [x] tree-structured xml (requires you to make the DataBase class)
- [x] ~~create the DepthListView~~
- [ ] revealInFinder and open in safari for path and URL
- [ ] save to xml after each remove and add and each repo-settings-update (this involves creating the dp->xml method)
- [ ] hook up the leftSideBar to app logic
- [ ] next is to create the activity list and load in the last 5 commits from each repo. and then sync repos
