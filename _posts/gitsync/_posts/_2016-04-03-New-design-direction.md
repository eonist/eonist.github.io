- The left-side-bar is hid-able. Add repos,folders,branches via right click
- The Entire layout can be scaled down to a ==compact mode==. Top menu will become icons rather than text. Etc.
- The top-bar has the different view modes. (Activity,edit,setup,stats)
- Parts of the layout will have gestures. 
- ==Pull down to sync.== (in edit mode and Activity mode)
- ==Night-mode== via shortcut or os-dropdown menu (black theme and white theme)
- App preferences via os drop-down-menu
- The hamburger menu could be replaced by a dropdown search popover box. Or stay a menu and have some contextual options. Further exploration needed. 
- Universal app. The same interface for ==Mac, Ipad and Iphone==
