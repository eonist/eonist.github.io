## Introduction
In tech. We need to validate products, features, and improvements fast. Because time and speed to market is so important. You are usually burning a lot of resources and money to get get a product into customer's hands. So the pressure is to push out products fast. Naturally. No problem. Just code fast. But wait. How does that work exactly?

## Coding fast
Use any means necessary to get from A to B. Skip fancy code, just use the simplest code you can write to get to a working prototype. Once you get there. Hold your horses. Test it with customers, get feedback. Is this worth refining from a stone to a diamond? If the answer is yes. The next phase is to clean up all the mess you made by moving fast.

## Coding slow
Refactor, refine, rebuild. With the feedback, you got from your customers. Add tests, documentation, improve the UX / UI, etc. And ship.

## Conclusion
Pretty simple really, yet I dare say that 90% of tech-establishments around the world skip the coding slow phase, just because the tech department usually has no influence or know-how when it comes to project management. But as problem solvers, this is a problem that can be solved, or it can at least be your competitive edge. Happy coding. Fast and slow.
