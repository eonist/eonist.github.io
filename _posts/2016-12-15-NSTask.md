NSTask lets you run command-line calls in your app<!--more--> My initial quest was to find a way to call multiple command line calls in one NSTask, But The proper cocoa way to do this would be to create an NSTask for each command, setting each taskâ€™s arguments as necessary. And Apparently using the NSTask in the first place is more of a hack and NSTask is known to be slow.ðŸ”‘ Rather you should try to find a Cocoa API for what you are trying to accomplish with NSTask. But Sometimes you need to test a theory first. Before diving deep into a complex API.

### Running a shell script in terminal:
1. Create my_script.sh
2. Add some commands: (every new line is a command call)
```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello world"
echo "Hello world"
```
3. In terminal write: 'chmod 755 ~/Desktop/my_script.sh' (this sets a permission to run the script)
4. In terminal write: '~/Desktop/my_script.sh'
5. Terminal should now say hello two times

### Run .sh files with NSTask:
 - The "-c" argument tells sh to parse the next argument as a script ðŸ”‘  
 - The "-c" also enables the command-line to find the correct path where the operation is located , so you don't have to specify the path for where the method echo is. You just write echo and command-line locates the path ðŸ”‘  
```swift
task.launchPath = "/bin/sh"
task.arguments = ["-c","~/Desktop/my_script.sh"]
```
my_script.sh: (remember to set permissions for it to be executed)
```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo $1#This should print additional arguments, but it doesnt seem to work
echo "Hello world"
echo "Saying hello again"
/usr/local/git/bin/git log -3 --pretty=format:"Sha1: %h"#calling a git method
```
This approach is able to call multiple commands from NSTask, but unable to pass arguments to the .sh script.

### Run a .sh shell script from NSTask with argument support:
By calling the .sh script from the launchPath and using .arguments the .sh + NSTask + argument support combo seem to work.

### ASync NSTask research:
```swift
if isRunning {//you set the isRunning your self when you run a task
  buildTask.terminate()//stops the task if it hangs etc
}
```
Execute a shell task asynchronously example:  
http://iswift.org/cookbook/execute-a-shell-task-asynchronously

To get notified of streaming data:  
listen to: ``NSFileHandleDataAvailableNotification``

```swift
// Create a Task instance
let task = NSTask()

// Set the task parameters
task.launchPath = "/usr/bin/env"
task.arguments = ["ls", "-la"]

// Create a Pipe and make the task
// put all the output there
let pipe = NSPipe()
task.standardOutput = pipe

let outputHandle = pipe.fileHandleForReading
outputHandle.waitForDataInBackgroundAndNotify()

// When new data is available
var dataAvailable : NSObjectProtocol!
dataAvailable = NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserverForName(NSFileHandleDataAvailableNotification,
    object: outputHandle, queue: nil) {  notification -> Void in
        let data = pipe.fileHandleForReading.availableData
        if data.length > 0 {
            if let str = NSString(data: data, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding) {
                print("Task sent some data: \(str)")
            }
            outputHandle.waitForDataInBackgroundAndNotify()
        } else {
            NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().removeObserver(dataAvailable)
        }
}

// When task has finished
var dataReady : NSObjectProtocol!
dataReady = NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserverForName(NSTaskDidTerminateNotification,
    object: pipe.fileHandleForReading, queue: nil) { notification -> Void in
        print("Task terminated!")
        NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().removeObserver(dataReady)
}

// Launch the task
task.launch()
```

### Todos:
- Try to speed test the NSTask + .sh + arguments combo.
- Try to speed test loop Multiple NSTask instance test
- Try to test the Async NSTask. Background processes are nice!
- Try searching for NSTask on github
- Gather more information
