### Prerequisites
**Q:** Why use holding structure (have two companies were one ownes the other)?    
**A:** To avoid paying 30% Direct tax on dividend, instead you pay ~3% and can redistribute the dividend to other business ventures as soon as you distribute to private consumption you pay the between 30%. The reasoning is that society has more benefit from people putting money into new business ventures than private consumption. (Also remember that regardless, all company surplus will be taxed with 22% so in many cases its better to do a combination pay high salaries and pay dividend for business redistribution)

**Q:** Why do I need 30k NOK to start a company?     
**A:** To register a company you add 30k NOK (3k$) to a locked account in your bank. Then get a confirmation from you bank that the money is locked. They are unlocked again after the company registration is complete

### Reregistering
