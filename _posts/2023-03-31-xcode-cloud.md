My notes on xCode cloud<!--more-->

- With xCode Cloud, you can now view your CI/CD system directly in Xcode.
- You can easily check your builds, change workflows, and identify which tests have failed. You can also navigate directly to the source code of any failed tests.
- In addition to viewing test results, you can also see snapshots from your tests and rebuild branches.
- Setting up Xcode Cloud is easy. Once you add it to your project, it automatically gains access to all provisioning profiles and certificates. You can then build your project and release it to TestFlight and the App Store with ease.
- Once Xcode Cloud is set up, all team members added to the project will automatically have access to view and run builds in Xcode. This eliminates the need to manually grant and revoke access.
