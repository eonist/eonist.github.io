My notes on making a simple one pager landing page with just css and html<!--more-->

1. create a website/website.md doc.
2. pseudo code in fenced code block
3. make **index.html** and style.css
4. convert pseudo-code to dummy boxes in the html and css
5. begin to add dummy text to html (lorem ipsum)
6. begin to improve spacing, alignment, font sizes etc.
7. begin to move css into imports
8. begin to add real text
9. begin to refine styles, add google fonts, and clean things up, remove dummy colors  
10. add support for responsive styles, mobile, iPad
11. add google analytics, fav.icon, etc. upload to github ðŸš€


### Gotchas:
- Use safari as the preview of the index.html
- Use a text editor for the html and css. Something like: VSCode
- Add a **reset.css** file to make it easier to style without interference from default browser styles etc
- In the beginning don't try to be too clever with styling, just use the simplest style to test things out. Do clever things later when things start to take shape
