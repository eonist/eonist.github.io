Some notes on swift .framework <!--more--> 

### Export:

1. Xcode -> New project -> Cocoa framework   
2. Add .swift files to your framework  
3. cmd + b (aka build)   

**If you want to build your framework along side your normal XCode project:**  

1. Save as target -> pick Cocoa framework  
2. Select .swift files and set their target membership to the .framework  
3. cmd + b (aka build)  

### Import:

1. Right click on the â€˜.frameworkâ€™ and select â€˜Show in Finderâ€™  
2. copy the .framework file in the same folder where your .swift files are. Then drag it into Xcode.  
3. In your new project: Project settings -> General -> Embedded binaries add the  .framework via the + buttonðŸ”‘   


### Access level:

Swift has three levels of access control. Use the following rules of thumb when creating your own frameworks:  
- **Public**: for code called by the app or other frameworks, e.g., a custom view.  
- **Internal**: for code used between functions and classes within the framework, e.g., custom layers in that view.  
- **Fileprivate**: for code used within a single file, e.g., a helper function that computes layout heights.  
- **Private**: for code used within an enclosing declaration, such as a single class block. Private code will not be visible to other blocks, such as extensions of that class, even in the same file, e.g., private variables, setters, or helper sub-functions.  
- **@testable** if you prefix your import with ``@testable`` then you can work with framework classes even if they are not marked public ðŸ”‘  


### Resources:
- Make a framework of your swift files in a xcode project. And also add **playground** that can import the framework: [here](https://medium.com/@LogMaestro/adding-playgrounds-to-your-xcode-project-79d5ea0c7087#.q27u3w639)   
- Use the a .framework file in other projects by copying it: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vChxJ_Nk6kI)  
- Export and Drag and drop .framework to different projects: [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/40991398/5389500)

### NOTES:

- Apple claims that its best to use less than 6 .frameworks in your app. Or else compile time may suffer  
- Dynamic frameworks supported after ios 8 on iOS. Dynamic frameworks are linked form your app, static frameworks are included in the app.
