My notes on complexity<!--more-->It's always the complexities that gets you. Creating something awesome is easy. Creating something that is awesome and not complex is hard

Basically you get to a point were you don't have the resources to maintain the creation.

### The sweet spot is:
1. Easy to maintain
2. High utility
3. Solves something elegantly

Too much complexity is unsustainable. It will limit your throughput and openness to new ideas.
