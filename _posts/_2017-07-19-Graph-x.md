Notes on GraphX <!--more--> 

#### Introduction:
GraphX is a gesture driven Graph component that automatically adjusts the y-axis while the user pans around.

#### Animating the y-axis adjustments:
The graph is driven by left to right scrolling-gestures

#### Pinch to zoom:
The zoom level can be set by simply pinching in and out

```swift
/*gif example coming soon*/
```
#### Why is automatically adjusting the y-axis important?
The y-axis is important to adjust because the sub-section that you currently see you only want to compare the y-axis in this section. Not the y-axis values of 2 years from now etc. You might want to do that too, but then you want to view from a birds-eyes-view. Not in the local scope your currently seeing. 

#### Why is GraphX cool?
Most Graph components are not very user friendly, they require many clicks and are cumbersome to use. GraphX can fly through time with simple swipes and even zoom in and out of time-units. Making it ultra convenient when you want to explorer and compare huge data sets in a hurry. To my knowledge combining the y-axis adjustment and the pinch to zoom in a graph has never been done before. And ive done a lot of Graph research before making GraphX.

#### Remarks:

- The Graph runs on the AnimLib which supports true interruptible animation (Spring and Easing)
- There is no X,Y value indicators, these will be added soon
- The graph will support smooth curves, different animation types and multiple graph lines
- The graph points will also be interactive, enabling future Popover boxes with additional info etc
- The data set can be loaded as JSON, XML or other data types as long as they adhere to the DataProvidable protocol
- The GraphX UI components are reused so its always ultra fast and friendly for battery driven devices. 
- The GraphX will work for all Apple devices. MacOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS
