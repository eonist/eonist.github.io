Notes on GraphX <!--more--> 

#### Introduction:
GraphX is a gesture driven Graph component that automatically adjusts the y-axis while the user pans around.

#### Animating the y-axis adjustments
The graph is driven by left to right scrolling-gestures

#### Pinch to zoom
The zoom level can be set by simply pinching in and out

```swift
/*gif example coming soon*/
```

#### Why is GraphX cool?
Most Graph components are not very user friendly, they require many clicks and are cumbersome to use. GraphX can fly through time with simple swipes and even zoom in and out of time-units. Making it ultra convenient when you want to explorer and compare huge data sets. To my knowledge combining the y-axis adjustment and the pinch to zoom in a graph has never been done before. And ive done a lot of Graph research before making GraphX.

#### Future support:

- The Graph runs on the AnimLib which supports true interruptible animation (Spring and Easing)
- The graph will support smooth curves, different animation types and multiple graph lines
- The graph points will also be interactive, enabling future Popover boxes with additional info etc
- The data set can be loaded as JSON, XML or other data types as long as they adhere to the DataProvidable protocol
- The GraphX UI components are reused so its always ultra fast and friendly for battery driven devices. 
- The GraphX will work for all Apple devices. MacOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS
