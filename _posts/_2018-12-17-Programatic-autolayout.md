My notes on programatic autolayout<!--more-->

## Why choose programatic AutoLayout

#### Pro's:
- Easy to maintain than InterfaceBuilder
- Easy to debug once something goes wrong (as appose to Interface Builder)
- Faster to cognitively grasp what AutoLayout does. IB has too many paramaters all over the place
- Easier to setup for complex rich interactivity / animation (THis is almost impossible in IB)
- Less parameters for more impact (Use of one-liners in snapKit, TinyConstraints and Spatial)
- The future is more and more Advance UI/UX and less boilerplate gerneric looks

#### Con's
- Slight learning-curve for iOS beginners
- Depends on third party lib to really write code efficiently
- Apples own programatic AutoLayout is verbose and powerful but more code means less simple to maintain
