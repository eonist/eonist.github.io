### Gotchas:
- Doodle and sketch out roughly how the UI should look
- Do broad spectrum research on the best possible way to design the component
- Design one component at the time
- focus on proportions at first with boxes and dummy colors, slowly add text and then real colors etc
- Once each component looks good isolated try to click components together
- If you try to design everything in one go, you will over-perfect and it will feel out of balance

### Todo:
- Draw steps on your iPad, add image etc
