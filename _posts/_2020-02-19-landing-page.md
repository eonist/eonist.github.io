### The problem
- Fullstack developer? ReactNative, Elm, Vue, Node.js? These technologies are for building the next facebook, not for simple websites. Also takes years to master at full cognition.
- Custom websites with all the latest techs are expensive to maintain and super un-secure because they rely on so many dependencies. Russion hackers
- One click websites, that are easy to setup hard to change. Wordpress isn't easy. Not free. Subscription model. Pay as you go. Can change their business model at any moment, traffic spike = problems.
- As a startup you have minimal real product content. And it usually looks crap. Doesn't go well with overly designed and animated wordpress themes.
- You want to start with something simple, but simple isn't flashy enough to sell. Get over that.
- You want something you can iterate. You don't have to go from zero-to looking like a million bucks.

### The solution
- Make something simple and iteratable (that you can grow with as you move forward)
- Make something that is free
- Make something that is 100% secure
- Make something that is industry standard (so that it can be maintained/upgraded cheaply)
- Handles traffic spikes with-out hick-ups (when you start trending)

### Get started
- Sign up for github (hosting)
- Name-cheap (custom domain optional)
- Custom design -> Sketch design -> HTML + CSS
- Fork a design (eonist/startup-landing-page)
- Add config files to github

### Adding content
- What is markdown? Quick overview. Link to learn more
- Edit markdown in (Atom, Word)
- Drag and drop (or use github-desktop)
- See the changes online (Check responsiveness)

### Add services
- Google analytics (Anonymous and GDPR-fiendly)
- Social services: (Add links) (Medium,Instagram,Twitter)
- Additional content: (Whitepaper.pdf / Roadmap.pdf / Handbook.pdf)
- Intercom

### Maintenance
- Adding new pages
- Adding different content (Video on the front, via vimeo etc)
- Editing the design (custom fonts from google, Animation via .js)
- Make local html+css experiments, use stackoverflow until it sort of works
- Then move to jekyll + liquid
- Stuck or too busy? Pay someone to make edits for you on freelancer.com etc (50-100$)
