Fitting a circle Given 4 points. p1, p2, p3, p4 <!--more--> 

#### The steps:

1. The converging point of the bisector angles for p2 and p3  gives you the centre of the circle.  
2. To find the radius: Project the orthogonal normal from the centre onto the line (p2,p3)
3. Draw the circle with the centre and the radius

(You can use a compass and a ruler to test this theory out)
