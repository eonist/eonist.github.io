My notes on swiftui for macOS <!--more-->

### Tips:
- Use view that fits: https://swiftwithmajid.com/2022/07/26/viewthatfits-in-swiftui/
- Use Conditional layouts in SwiftUI https://swiftwithmajid.com/2022/08/16/conditional-layouts-in-swiftui/

### Gotchas:
-  To get live preview working for macOS apps. Remember to add mac w/ appkit as a target in your app settings. iPad app as MacApp target will not be enough to be able to show macos app live preview
