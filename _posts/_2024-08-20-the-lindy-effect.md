### Preamble:
The Lindy Effect is a concept that suggests the longer an item or idea exists, the longer it's likely to continue existing in the future. This effect is particularly applicable to non-perishable items such as information, intellectual production, and technologies. The rationale behind this notion is that the hazard rate, or the chance of "dying" (in this case, becoming obsolete), decreases with age ². In other words, something that has already survived a certain amount of time is more likely to survive further than something younger ³⁴. This concept can be seen in various fields, including technology and ideas, where older items or concepts tend to have longer lifespans due to their established presence and proven longevity. ⚠️️ shorten this a bit

### Hitching a ride with trends can spawn lindy effects
Say you jump on the latest and greatest trend in technology. there is always something new around the corner. 
If you blog about this new trend, or write a tutorial, or build something with it or for it. Since you are now early. It will compound. People will upvote your stackoverflow answer explaining how to fix something with it. or people will upvote your blog post. Even more interesting. all these AI models will soon have to give credit where credit is due. So that blog post or answer that has coumpounded. The AI model will weight it highly. And then many people using GPT or perplexity will then also want to click the original source to see context and followups beyond what the AI model can give. Imagine getting 1000s of backlinks from AI models a day. This might be a new dawn of SEO "Search engine optimization" but instead it wil AMO "AI Model Optimization"

### How startups can ride the lindy effect
Lindy effect is moat. Incumbants. how you dont have to worry abut copy cats. no startup ever failed because it got outcompeted by copycats. because if your timing is right. lindy effect should make you grow so fast, that its not economically justfied to try and copy you. at least not outcompete you and make you fail. you might not take the entire market. you might have to share it with cop cats. but having two digits of the market is unbelivably gd. so not something you should be worried about. ⚠️️ clean up this, make it shorter

### The turkey feels the most safe the day before thanks giving (the blind side of the lindy effect)
Because it has been safe for the longst time. So it thinks it must continue. this is working. the lindy effect is working. Similar examples in real life. Silicon vally bank. All these startups felt that was the best bank because it had been around the longst. it worked. right up until it didnt work then it went to zero. lke the turkey. And the last day before it went to zero, the employees at that bank had never felt more laxed, and routines where laxed. no need to invest in risk managment. lindy effect is so strong.

over time. people lax. you see this with doctors without borders as well. they now even added a counter measure where you are sent back home after your lindy effect peaks. its 2 months. after 2 months doctors feel so safe and routine that they stop being careful with protection etc. 

Taleb wrote about this in the black swan. How noise is gd to avoid complacent relacation. many small turmoils are better than one big one. the antifragile. small crises keeps us on our toes so we guard and hedge and learn to counter the big fall outs. SO instead of trusting one bank with a long streak. all eggs in one basket. the science say we should spread our risk. ⚠️️ clean up this, make it shorter

Pan Am, Nokia, Credit Suisse, Enron, Lehman brothers and others that had a long successful history, but did not make it to the present. Using the Lindy effect in a hubris manner with no realistic assessment of the threats is ignorance. Failing to adapt to new global changes in tech, social and economic developments

### Aging in reverse
“If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not ‘aging’ like persons, but ‘aging’ in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life!”

### The limits of the lindy effect:
While the Lindy effect is a good heuristic, it has its limits.

The music charts show that a number one single can and will drop off the top charts even if it has been at number one for many weeks. Likewise, Although Lindy’s Deli was in operation for a long time, it eventually closed in 2018.

Similarly, legacy industries and giants are suspectable to upstarts who come along and approach old problems in fresh ways.

However, these examples also show the value of the Lindy Effect.

With the music chart, it’s more likely that the song from the 70s which is still popular will remain in the top 40 than the new single that shoots to number one.

And although new upstart companies do replace legacy businesses and industries, they do so by solving the underlying desires in new way. While the solutions change, the principles remain.

Being Lindy doesn’t mean that something cannot disappear tomorrow. It just says we have reasons to believe it’s less likely than it would be if it hadn’t been around for so long.

### Is AI the ultimate disruptor of the lindy effect?
The lindy effect is great at building a moat. but AI has no moat. So we have to think differently. Your AI wrapper can be as easily unwrapped as it was wrapping it up in the firstplace.

Things to investigate. Moats in AI. Build the middle layer. The lower level models surly has no moat as they all are pretty similar by now and will remain more and more similar. the higher level wrapper apps. can all be made in 2 weeks. so competative edge here remains slim. So build the middle layer. the hw / sw around the ai. But the issue here is. this middle layer can it self be built blazing fast with AI code editors and the likes. what about brand? or data silos? scraping with AI has never been easier. so low level of moat on data silos. brands can be designed with figma with AI. Anything else? capital is still scarce. And something AI isnt able to have an effect on. Access to capital. Capital is in it self the perfect example of the lindy effect, if you have a lot of it over a long time. it will probably grow and be ever lasting. Unless you play with too much risk.

### Lessons of the lindy effect
- Prefer the timeless and tested to the new and novel
- There’s certainly value in new ideas and experiences but they are less likely to last. 
- If they demonstrate timeless, underlying value or principles then they are more likely to be valuable in the long run.

### Lindy effect and coding:
The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the time.
—Tom Cargill, Bell Labs
However long it has taken us to get a project “close to done,” it will probably take that much time again to really be done. It’s funny because it’s true.

as such. your ambitions should probably be 10% of what your initial assumtion of what you need to build.

### The lindy effect and growth:
So the “startup growth” version of this rule is: You can probably double your size by doing what you’re already doing, but 10x will require innovation.

Im on the fence here. It might be the same old same old. Where some AI products ride the lindy effect all the way and become dominant lego bricks in the web of our reality. Or not. What do you think? Would love to hear your take on this.

### Things that has lindy effect and things that doesnt:
HAS
- Founders. You build a company. that will endure and reap the rewards into the future. 
  
HAS NOT:
- Software devs: your basically killing your own job. the more code you write. the more likley you complete the project and you will have to find something else todo after. 
- A car. The more you drive it. the more likley it will cease to be valuable, unless you live in havanna.

[1What's the Lindy Effect? - Definition, Examples, and More — Wealest](https://www.wealest.com/articles/lindy-effect)[2The Lindy Effect](https://medium.com/@LucaDellAnna/the-lindy-effect-af799df5355c)[3Lindy effect - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)[4The Lindy Effect: Definition, Examples, and Generalization [2024 update] - Luca Dellanna](https://luca-dellanna.com/lindy/)[5ModelThinkers - The Lindy Effect](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/the-lindy-effect)

The Lindy Effect is a concept that suggests the longer something has existed, the longer it is likely to continue to exist in the future. This principle is primarily applied to non-perishable entities such as ideas, technologies, and cultural phenomena. Here are some main points regarding the Lindy Effect:

1. **Definition and Origin**: The Lindy Effect was popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book "Antifragile." It posits that for non-perishable items, the expected remaining lifespan increases with age. For example, if a book has been in print for 40 years, it is expected to remain in print for another 40 years[](https://www.wealest.com/articles/lindy-effect)[](https://luca-dellanna.com/lindy/).
2. **Applications**: The Lindy Effect is used to assess the robustness and longevity of various entities. It is often applied to literature, cultural practices, and technologies. For instance, classic novels and enduring cultural practices are seen as more likely to persist due to their historical longevity[](https://www.theurbanchapter.com/the-lindy-effect-nurturing-time-tested-bonds/)[](https://luca-dellanna.com/lindy/).
3. **Practical Implications**: The Lindy Effect encourages focusing on long-lasting and time-tested ideas or practices. It suggests that consuming content that has stood the test of time, such as classic books, is more beneficial than engaging with transient trends or daily news[](https://www.wealest.com/articles/lindy-effect)[](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/the-lindy-effect).
4. **Limitations**: While the Lindy Effect provides a framework for understanding longevity, it does not account for disruptive changes or the natural decay of perishable items. It is probabilistic, not deterministic, meaning it estimates the likelihood of continued existence rather than guaranteeing it[](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/the-lindy-effect)[](https://luca-dellanna.com/lindy/).
5. **Cultural and Philosophical Impact**: The Lindy Effect also influences how people view relationships and personal well-being. Long-standing relationships and traditional wellness practices are valued for their proven durability and benefits over time[](https://www.theurbanchapter.com/the-lindy-effect-nurturing-time-tested-bonds/).

Overall, the Lindy Effect serves as a mental model to evaluate the potential longevity and relevance of various entities, encouraging a focus on enduring rather than ephemeral aspects of life.

The Lindy Effect impacts the adoption of new technologies by providing a framework for evaluating their potential longevity and relevance. Here are some key points on how it influences technology adoption:

1. **Preference for Established Technologies**: The Lindy Effect suggests that technologies that have been around for a longer time are more likely to continue being relevant. This can lead to a preference for adopting established technologies that have demonstrated resilience and reliability over time[](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/TechnicalExperts/blob/main/writing/lindy_effect.md)[](https://fourweekmba.com/lindy-effect/).
2. **Cautious Approach to Novelty**: The Lindy Effect encourages a cautious approach to adopting new technologies. It advises against quickly embracing novel innovations without rigorous evaluation, as newer technologies may not yet have proven their durability or adaptability[](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lindy-effect-embracing-timeless-wisdom-ever-changing-world-mohanty).
3. **Influence on Investment Strategies**: Companies and investors might use the Lindy Effect to guide their investment strategies, favoring technologies with a longer track record of success. This can reduce risks associated with investing in untested or transient technologies[](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/TechnicalExperts/blob/main/writing/lindy_effect.md).
4. **Challenge from Disruptive Innovations**: Despite its insights, the Lindy Effect does not fully account for disruptive innovations that can rapidly replace established technologies. This highlights a limitation of the effect, as it may overlook the potential for new technologies to quickly gain dominance[](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/TechnicalExperts/blob/main/writing/lindy_effect.md).
5. **Implications for Decision-Making**: Understanding the Lindy Effect can influence decision-making by promoting the evaluation of technologies based on their historical longevity. This can lead to more informed choices regarding technology adoption and integration into business strategies[](https://fourweekmba.com/lindy-effect/).

Overall, while the Lindy Effect provides valuable insights into technology adoption, it also requires consideration of the potential for disruption and the need for adaptability in a rapidly changing technological landscape.

  
### Lurker ideas:
  
The intriguing aspects of the Lindy Effect, especially in the context of technology, that could captivate an audience include:
1. Counterintuitive Nature: The idea that the longer a technology has existed, the longer it is likely to continue existing is counterintuitive. This goes against the common perception that newer is always better, which can be a surprising and engaging concept for readers.
2. Applications to Technology Adoption: The practical application of the Lindy Effect in choosing which technologies to adopt or invest in can be very relevant for business leaders, investors, and technologists. This aspect ties historical longevity to future potential, offering a unique lens for strategic decision-making.
3. Challenge from Disruptive Innovations: The tension between the Lindy Effect and disruptive technologies presents a dynamic narrative. While the Lindy Effect suggests a preference for older, established technologies, disruptive innovations often rapidly change the landscape, challenging the predictions of the Lindy Effect. This conflict can lead to rich discussions and insights.
4. Influence on Investment Strategies: How the Lindy Effect can guide investment strategies and reduce risks associated with new, untested technologies is particularly relevant in today’s fast-paced economic environment. This can appeal to readers interested in financial strategies and technology investments.
5. Philosophical and Cultural Impact: The broader implications of the Lindy Effect on how we view longevity and value in our personal and professional lives can resonate on a deeper level with the audience. This can lead to a more reflective and philosophical engagement with the content.
These elements not only provide depth to the discussion of the Lindy Effect but also connect with various interests and concerns of a diverse audience, making the topic both informative and thought-provoking.
