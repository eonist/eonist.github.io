My notes on SPM<!--more-->

## Basic gotchas:
`swift package init` Creates the init SPM project
`swift package init --type library` ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Untested ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è
`swift build` Builds dependencies
`swift package generate-xcodeproj` Makes xCode proj
`swift package update` Updates dependencies

### Other gotchas:
- Use a framework target in your app project as an umbrella framework so that you don't have to rebuild src code on every build. (Because SPM only handles src code)
- Make sure packages build, before you add them as dependencies. Or else xCode may crash etc
- Instead of adding SPM dependencies to xcode, one by one. You could add a local SPM repo with dependencies, now you have a package.swift you can edit with an editor. Even test with terminal üëå

## Target branch:
```swift
dependencies: [
	.package(url: "https://github.com/eonist/B.git", .branch("master"))
]
```

## Define os version
Sometimes some API is only available above some OS version. Specify this in the platforms variable
```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "TodoSwiftUIComponents",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v12), .macOS(.v10_13)],
    ...
)
```
