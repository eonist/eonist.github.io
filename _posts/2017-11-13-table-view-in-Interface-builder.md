My notes on TableView in iOS for Interface builder <!--more-->

- Hock up your `TableView` to a `NavigationController` via: `Editor -> Embed in -> Navigation Controller`
- If you don't want a list but a scroller view with items, similar to a prefs view. Then set the content prop to static. ðŸ”‘
- ctrl-drag from UI items in InterfaceBuilder to create connections to the code
