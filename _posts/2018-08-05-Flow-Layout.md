FlowLayout is a minimal starter-kit for making modern iOS apps<!--more-->.

### Concept:
The idea is to give aspiring app developers a dead simple "vanilla" swift library to start with. Just add some end point calls to instagram and you could literally have a minimal insta client in a day. Edit live.

### Description:
- I wanted to make a very responsive fluid app like instagram or snapchat. But using apples own app framework always ended up feeling kind of outdated and slow. 
- The concept is really simple. It's just 1 horizontal UICollection and 1 vertical UICollection. 
- The current version uses only 1 RootViewController. 
- The CollectionViews are UIViews with delegate handlers. This makes it really easy to transition to another ViewController. 
- And it also enables you to embed FlowLayout in pure UIView setups like an image picker or alike.
