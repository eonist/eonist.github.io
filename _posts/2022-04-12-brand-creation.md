These are my notes on the process of creating a brand, including tips on concept development, personality and vision, and website creation.<!--more-->

### Concept / brand creation
- Iterating is a crucial part of the brand creation process, as it allows you to refine your ideas and improve the end product.
- Innovation is 50% vision and 50% technology.
- Study the structure of the industry you're entering intensively.
- The more time you spend, the better the end product (1-3 months).
- Even if you find something great early, keep going. You will find something better.
- Check Pinterest, Instagram, and Dribbble every day and every night.
- When you hit research saturation in one direction, explore others. Embrace dead ends, as they are valuable findings for making connections in later stages of exploration.

**Figuring out personality / vision / direction / mood**
- This step is challenging and requires both shallow and deep research. The 80/20 rule definitely applies here, as most of the time you will be going down dead-end rabbit holes. However, this research is valuable because it helps you develop a mental map of what not to do, making it faster to find the most optimal solution later. To quote Thomas Edison: "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." 
- You have to immerse yourself in a lot of data, including competitors, the state of the industry, and the state of adjacent industries. This is key to understanding what you want to build. You're inventing the future, so at the very least, you have to understand the past and the present and how to avoid just making what has been.

**Once you understand the overall direction**
- Quantity is key when brainstorming ideas. From quantity, you can better reach quality. Get as many associated keywords and theme keywords down on paper as you can, and keep expanding related keywords. Use addition and subtraction to discover new ideas, and mark the most relevant words to try to make them work with the direction you picked. Try to envision the brand in the context of URL, mark, name, and product.
- Try to figure out the beginning, the point where it starts. From there, everything should deterministically unfold itself. Seed -> Seedling -> Plant -> Tree -> Forest. Wrong seed, wrong forest.

**When you have direction, name, and notion of a mark**
- Create sub-directions of the core direction, such as geometrical, abstract, wavy, pulsing, recursive, and revolving.
- Begin to iterate the mark/logo by creating a variation matrix, an 8x4 grid of marks of the same idea but slightly different. Pick the best one and keep trying to improve it a few times with 4-8 variations. Then pick the best of that. 

**Now it's time to create a website**
- Make the most stripped-down version you can.
- Add only the most essential parts, the top 3 things.
- You can add more later when you have more feedback.
- Adding too much upfront will limit your ability to iterate in the right direction (very important).

### Gotchas
- Iterating and learning is more effective than planning and executing, as demonstrated by the spaghetti experiment where kids building structures with spaghetti sticks and gum outperformed MBA executives trying to plan and execute.
- It will be hard, but you will be able to create something others easily can't. They will want to copy you.
- Everything is a scientific process. Your job is just to apply it.
- Compose website copy from keywords and create an extensive keyword map of the subject you want to write about.
