## Pro
- Writing tests first gives us a clear perspective on the API design, by getting into the mindset of being a client of the API before it exists.
- Good tests serve as great documentation of expected behavior.
- some tests for core functionality is good

## Con
- hard to pivot after many tests are written 
- hard to reorg code 
- hige code coverage makes code burocratic

### RGR ( Red — Green — Refactor ) ?


Red, Green and Refactor are stages of the TDD (Test Driven Development).

Red: Write a small amount of test code usually no more than seven lines of code and watch it fail.
Green: Write a small amount of production code. Again, usually no more than seven lines of code and make your test pass.
Refactor: Tests are passing, you can make changes without worrying. Clean up your code. There are great workshop notes here.
