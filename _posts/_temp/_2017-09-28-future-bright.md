### The great filter theory

There is this theory called the great filter. Evolutionary theory. Each step in evolution single cell to multi cell. Stone to agro, agro to industrial. The next filter I feel is github. Like sure itâ€™s industrial to digital. But if digital then social fabrics has to change. See software you make once and never again. The great filter is the theory that the reason the cosmos is absent of life except earth is because no one gets past one of these filters to the ultimate goal of interstellar communication and travel. Opensource/github could be the thing that gets us past the final filter or we could just keep fighting and never get past the filter. The GF theory also states that we could also be past the final filter.


### Ledger of trust

There is a huge trust problem in software today. Apps that claim they are free upfront but really aren't, i'm looking at you in-app-purchase. Apps that steal your information. Apps that report back to mothership with out your consent. Obtrusive popups that try to sell other apps to you, even if you paid for the app already. How is the consumer suppose to differentiate which apps are ethical and which are not? The solution is trust. If the consumer can quickly glans a trust ledger he can quickly make up his mind if the app is ethical. This trust ledger isn't the comments in app-store as they are designed for the app maker not the user. And can be easily gamed and curated to weed out bad comments. 

The trust ledger must be a neutral part. Something that cant be gamed, curated or censored. What comes to mind is GitHub. GitHub is a Tree of trust. You can quickly assess if a developer is trust-worthy or not. As he can only build this trust over time. There are lots of users I would trust in a heart beat. People I know are not scammy and wouldn't risk their reputation over adding scammy components to their apps to earna  buck or two.
