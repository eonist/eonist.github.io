### Researching the hidden


1. Define your question

2. Is there related information that can confirm that your question can be answered. The more related information there is the more likely there is an answer.

3. Are there related similar theories. 

4. Try isolated experiments to make your mind more absorbent to the correct hunches. 

5. Try for the simplest cases. Mini experiments.

6. Try your behemoth theory from time to time. But if it doesn't work. Keep trying the simplest experiments. Your mind will just keep getting more absorbent to the sort of gotchas that will lead to the correct answer. The trick is to soak your brain in as much relevant and related information as possible in a short amount of time. 

7. Force your self to try over and over until it works. Don't quit. this is not everyday. You do this now and then. Your brain can take it. go 20h straight if you must. If you quit your brain will shed the mini gotchas you just picked up in the research frenzy you just did. Your brain is like a swamp, over time the water/information will excpell and evaporate. You have to nail this in the now. Think of it as a hackthon. When you nail it. It's done. You can relax and refine your answer and make it perfect. This next period is pure heaven and you can really enjoy it. But until then your life is hell. Sorry. No way around this.

8. Keep trying. Envelope your mind in the quest for the answer. Consume your self. But don't let weeks/months go by. If you keep hitting the wall. write down your findings and gather more in-depth information. Write a whitepaper to straighten your mind. Ask others for an opinion on your whitepaper. Do more deep research into peripheral references etc.

9. Sometimes the final answer is a set of 4-5 gotchas that combine into an elegant answer. But among 20-40 similar plausible gotchas you find while researching, there is an all most infinite sea of combinations. to unlock the final combination you have to use the human intuition. In the beginning only 1 or 2 gotachas work. after many attempts 2-3 start to work and you only need to fit that last gotcha. This is usually the hardest part so keep at it. The more you work on it and read the better your intution for picking the right combination of gotachs will be. 

10. Works every time: Go for a walk if your stuck. Brain needs oxygen.
