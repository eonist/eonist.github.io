Hackathons are great. You gather your friends and push your limits in a short amount of time. Sort of like building a treehouse when you were a kid. So much fun and the summers seemed to never end. Best friends forever! Hackthons are great for exploring ideas that are a little "too long in the tooth" to do accomplish all on your own. Were all busy right? So lets do this together! There are some gotchas however. Because it's dreams that fuel hackathons. The what if moments. This could really be something big that we are doing! Then all of a sudden its not just a treehouse anymore but real investment and real open ended possibilities. At which point there must be some core principles to adhere to. These are my general observations in such an event and should be thought of before embarking into the digital equivalent of building a treehouse together:

#### Unanimous vote or hang the jury
Now I don't believe in [design by committee](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/why-design-by-commitee-should-die/). But at the same time there has to be unanimous vote to block irrational decisions from becoming priority. I really believe encouraging taking chances and following rabbits down rabbit holes. These excursions are often both costly and irrational but necessary for innovation to take place. No risk no reward so to speak. As long as these excursions have a documented rationale behind them they should be encouraged. What should not be encouraged is opinionated ramblings that change direction on a whim. If you want the team to change direction, be prepared to put in the work. Champion your new direction idea. Make a [rationale document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationale)  that outlines the "why" and "how" so that "argumentation-resolution" isn't lost in long chat threads of hyperbolic and unfair back and forth "tip-of-the-nose-like-arguments". 

#### 'Don't Do Stupid Shit' Barack Obama
The main point about [Unanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimity) is that it allows smart members to block stupid shit from happening. Because the idiots that want to do "stupid shit" has the burden of collecting analysis to convince the smart members. In the opposite case: If you only need majority, all you have to do is politic/propaganda to do stupid shit. And the smart members has to double up on politics to avoid stupid shit from happing, which turns them into politicians , which probably will make them do "stupid shit" because they wont have time to do deep analysis or get any work done. When you have the ability block, you don't have to focus on convincing idiots. They have to do the work convince you. Now if idiots decides to block good decisions, all you have to do is sell/surrender your stake. You don't want to hang out with idiots anyways. 

**For the record:** The terms "idiots" and "smarts" are used as a metaphor in-order to hit home the concept of Unanimity more easily. I do not believe people are more idiotic than others. However I do believe that sometimes people has a more shallow assessment of the situation. And other times people have a deeper and more cohesive assessment of the situation with the information available. 

#### Saying things repeatedly does not change important established direction.
Even worse, those with the least on their plates can maintain the most Slack presence, which leads to the most gregariously unengaged representing the majority of the discussion base while penalizing those who are fully engaged in their ‚Äúreal‚Äù work. If you disagree then it's your job to provide more  [in depth ananlysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper)  and sway team. There is a big difference between saying what you think is right and actually putting it requires to create a thorough analysis document. This also avoids [rateocracy](https://www.brunswickgroup.com/publications/brunswick-review/issue-9/rateocracy/)  from happening. Where You vote on every little thing and in the end manipulate the direction you "think" is best. If a discussion is pivotal use your analytic skills and put in the hours required. Present your lengthy rationale for the team and accept the outcome. If you picked a smart team they will always agree with the best idea. If they don't, then your probably on the wrong team and should head for the escape pod ASAP.

#### Product ownership
Give your team ownership or suffer from power struggles, fear of losing controls, and general Game of throne-ism. if your team owns your company/product they will have only one goal in mind, championing the product. Give them an even ownership stake. Be a musketeer. All for one and one for all. If you want to only give a small share consider hiring someone that is worth 33% when expanding your team from 2 to 3. That person you only wanted to give 2% can be hired as a freelancer or as an external company where they have their own ownership stake. Equally as important: Find partners that have the same musketeer philosophy as you have.

#### Conclusion:
I'll be honest. [Measuring impact is hard](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mastly-equity-as-a-service) . Probably impossible if you attempt to analyse all the edge cases and fall outs these leads to. The key take away is that you should be extra care full when picking the team you want to be on. Smart people are usually a winner. But make sure their stubbornness can be reasoned with and that it doesn't drain your energy/happiness. If you have to spend most of your time fighting irrational opinions and not actually getting anything done, then that is a good sign that you should re-evaluate your participation. Puhhh üòÖ. This post got a bit darker than I planed. Oh well. Here is the good news. In the age of github: Collaboration can take place with no friction at all. for instance: "cross collaborating". By sharing similar findings and working on separate outcomes. Things can cross pollinate and merge and un-merge with out organizational friction. This is also a great way to find others with similar mindsets that you can evaluate engaging in more "direct" teamwork with later. Testing the waters first, so to speak.
