Its always the complexites that gets you. Creating something that is awesome is easy. creating something that is awesome and not complex is hard

Basically yo get to a point were you dont have the resources to maintainn the creation.

the sweet spot is easy to maintain, high utility, solves something elegantly.

Too much complexity is unsustainable. it will limit your throughput and openness to new ideas
