How to run your next startup entirely on github <!--more-->



### Labour of love 
Committing code is a little like wood chopping. After a long and sweaty day in the forest, struggling with bugs and tooling that fails you when you least expect it, you finally see the result as a stack of lumber, which closley translates to a stack of commits in the digital realm. One on piece of wood stacked on top of the other. It's a satisifying sight to behold. Some lumps are torny and still have twigs sticking out. Similar to how some commits are rough around the edges and could be improved with some pruning. The end result of your hard work is visble to the naked eye, and you have something to show for your hard work, something to show managment, co workers and your self. A chunk of work written into the history of the project, something tangible that says something about who you are, what choices you made, what shortcuts where taken and exactly how much elbow grease you put into it. 2 weeks of work that can be investigated, probably something you wont be proud of 2 years from now but that doesn't matter. The work is there for your entire company to see and it will fuel your motivation in next endevour you take on. Sometimes your work is apploauded other times its critizised and improvments are suggested by your colegues and peers. Yet other times you can feel like your head is always tipping under water, and your struggeling to breath because the tasks keep coming in and your having trouble finding a foothold to keep up with the ever increasing complexity and scope. Estimating tasks starts to become difficult, but by using the commit history and pull-request comment threads from the last completed task you are able to give a more accurate estimate. Maybe there were bottlenecks you had to overcome like happened in commit id: `dv7e22` and also in `ku3ce`. Estimates are complex, and are increasing in complexity as a project grows. Simply asking for estimates doesn't cut it anymore. Managment has to be integrated in to the platform where the work happens, not simply be asigners and time keepers. Non-techinical managers needs to keep up with the times and learn how to look under the hood (aka read commit descriptions) and be able to understand consequences of organizational friction and how "feature creep" has a tendency to lead to bottlenecks when developing software. The image bellow is from my recent experience with wood chopping. I estimated id complete it in a weekend, but in the end it took 10 days. Doing something the first time always takes longer than you expect, but everytime I walk by it It feels satisfying to look at.

### Slow traction 
Build something epic and they will come they say. On the contrary, Sindre Sorhus as built a reputation for building software over time. Slowly building traction and publicity around what he builds. Meticulously churning out small improvments to obscure modules that make up the array of digital products he now posses on his github profile. Popularity and success are properties that usually arrive very asymetrically. Sindre has understood that many small streams can form a big river. Everything that he codes adds to the overall feedback loop of his entire hyper organization, spanning 100s of developers from all over the world chipping in for free, all the while he masterfully manages it all on github from a cafe in Thailand. 

Understood that products doesnt have to be shipped when they are ready, but are shipped over time

 Bit bucket and gitlab feels uninspiring and closed of. And does not foster the instrimsic motivation humans needs to push things forward.
