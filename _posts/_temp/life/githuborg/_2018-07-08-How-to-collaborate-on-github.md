How to collaborate on github<!--more-->. 
### Introduction:

>A much overlooked part of software making is how we choose to organize. How we can share the amount of work evenly and keep team-mates and contributors motivated. These are some of my observations on how we can organize better on GitHub.

 ### **TLDR;**
 >  We are all busy right? And we don’t have time for long reads anymore. That’s ok, you can just fork this book, download the pdf or star it and revisit it later at your convenience. The book is about how we can stay motivated when we collaborate on github, how we can avoid feature-creep and complexity and how we can handle unrealistic expectations and deadlines. Please feel free to give feedback or suggest further reading, I can’t guarantee that it will make it in to the book, as I want it to be as succinct as possible. But it wouldn't be a very good book about collaboration if it only ever had one contributor. 🙏

It's written from the point of view of the developer as oppose to being written top-down by management. Opinions are my own and may not necessarily reflect the views of companies I work for.
