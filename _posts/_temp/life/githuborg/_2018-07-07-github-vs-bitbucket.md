Being a core developer on a big project is so much more than hammering out features. reviewing pull requests, managing personal and external opensource projects that are used in the day to day business. Staying uptodate with convention,  porting projects and its dependencies to support the latest language api changes, writing blog posts about methodologies in order to understand them. Writing demo projects to test new theories. 


//100% of my time on github, call me a native github, i manage my career on github as oppose to linkdin. I get most of my freelance inqueries and job oppertunities as a result of my visibility on github. Frankly github is what puts bread on the table. 
Just like how maintaing a relevant dribbble profile is crusial for a graphic designers and having songs on soundcloud is alpha omega for aspiring musicans , as is github for developers. Is your work impactful? Do you write with the highest standard of the industry? Education, work experience and network still count, to a degree, but its probably only a matter of time before unbiased CI quality bots are applied to student exams. Imagine students getting a grade seconds after they "commit" their exam. Ai bots analysing meaning, grammar, impactfullness and degree of plagarism in nano seconds. 


I recently joined a tech company in Oslo. Great people, great idea. And great hustling spirit. And thus they try to save wherever they can. Which is a good thing. As such they try to use free services whereever they can. Google docs for pdf sahring, slack for communication, asana for issue tracking and task assignment, bitbucker for private code repos and github for public repos. All adding up to the cost of zero $. However there is a hidden cost attached, namly complexity and lost oppertunity. 

You can create a digital product on string budget. But in my opinion you can save a lot of money by joining the SaaS eco system and paying for services that will save you time. Definitly bootstrap the MVP and ship the product to market. But once you start a company and are dependent on creating a culture for producing code of high quality, then its time to re-strap and pay for a few services that will give your developers super powers. It could mean paying 25$-100$ monthly for services but it would enable your developer team of 2-3 people to do the job of 5-6 developers. 

### Minimum Personal SaaS budget
My modest personal service/bot budget toolbelt looks something like this:Codebeat 20$ month, Github 7$ month, circle CI 39$ a month. I use this service to help maintain the code quality of the projects and also so that I am updote and have the in-depth knowledge of how to operate these services in a professional context. Small cost, high impact for my self and for companies I work for. 

### Minumum Profecional SaaS budget
If your more than one developer on a team its crucial to invest in Continues intigration. No more but it compiles on my maschine. In this day and age almost 1005 OUR WORK is possible to do asyncronasly. And as such work that your team mates push should not be able to break CI. If it does than it also breaks everyones work and casuses bottle necks. Github has CI integration for pullrequests and commits. 

The cost of poor code quality. 
Its rummoured that microsfot is launching a new phone os, which they have spent years developing with a huge team, but its most likley being cancled because the overall code quality is so bad that its beyond saving. 

80% is maintinance/code improve 2+% is new features. yet many projects think of software as 1++% building

### Colaboration
Github is all about insentives collaboration. Spending time on the mundane and impactfull over the exiting and noticable but ultimaly only adds feature creeep and complexity of the product. 


Ideas an products are fueled by dreams and aspirations. A motivated developer has a lot more impact on a product than trying to save 25$ a month.

Github fosters to team culture. Quality code. Github motivates you to get up in the morning and write a test for things you know no one is going to care about. At least you can opensource it and maybe get some stars or interest from other developers. Maybe even land your next job. 

Github's infamous commit-graph streaks also motivates you to keep hustling. I totally respect devs who has blanks for saturday and sundays. To be honist whenever i see that i think the world is a better place. 

Github also offers tracking features such as insight, where you can see where trafic is comming from the internet, or if your co-workers really reviewed the code or not. 

Github isnt just a great git service, its also an always on convention center displaying your prowness and previouse digital products you have made. There is nothing that motivates a developer more than creating something in the open, getting feedback on your creation, growing your profeccional skills on the way. ascending to different places in life. Or not, sometimes products totally fails in the market, but thats ok. Its all about trying the unlikley and keep getting experience. 

Different people have different motivators. Some are motivated by money, some are founders at startups and are motivated by getting their business sold and cashing out. Most likley your a regular employee at a company doing what you can to help the company excell. I have a few friends at google and with out exception they all dream of branching out on their own venture, but at the end of the day that efty paycheck is keeping them tied up. 

IN my opinion encouraging employees to write opensource modules has a great effect on the productline for your company and the motivation of the emplyee. The dymaics is something like this: Employees that are allowed to write opensource modules just care more about what they are building, they have a stake in the overarching outcome of the company that is beyond money.
