### Asynchronous issues
Prefer asynchronous collaboration over synchronous. As work becomes ever more complex and deep. humans need less shallow focus and that means less interruption. Github handles this quite elegantly through issues. where one has to take extra care and be succinct in both asking and answering. Github recently also added edit history so one can investigate original issue and solution proposals which encourage even more carefulness and less wasted mental bandwidth.

### Asynchronous QA
Questions and answers should be encapsulated in [stack-overflow-team-edition](https://stackoverflow.com/teams) 10$/m . So that the QA isn‚Äôt lost in fleeting slack threads that may get lost forever (The free Slack account periodically wipes history). So that QA can be revisited as time progress. Instead of asking team-mates directly you can alias them `@` in SO team and also optionally ping them on slack if it's urgent (With a link to the SO team question). That way you avoid a lot of friction when having to interrupt co-workers while they are really busy solving XYZ. And your team mates gets visible credit for helping out. Just a small token like an upvote. For instance a lot of questions have to be repeatedly asked, maybe someone on your team is in charge of the backend and you have to ask him how something works and suggest upgrades. Maybe something is complicated and may break when language versions migrate to new versions and the QA needs frequent updates. Maybe many of your team-mates needs to ask the same question to the same person. At this point slack just doesn't cut it. Instead the person in charge of the backend can point in the direction of the previously answered question. Even if its related, developers can usually grasp the gist and get on with their day. Developers are very self sufficient, and often feel frustrated if they have to resort to synchronous communication. 

### Core developer syndrome
If we are being honest with our selfs for a minute, collaboration is hard. Look at almost all of the top repositories on github from apple/swift, Lona, lottie, alamofire and even Atom. They all have a 1 or 2 core developers coding about 90% of the code. On the surface this is true even for something as complex as apple/swift, even though there are 4-5 people with the bulk of the commits, if you divide it up in time periods there is 1 or 2 guys doing the majority of the code. [Chris Lattner](https://github.com/lattner) solely in the beginning. Even huge open-source project such as [github/atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/)  which has 100s of contributors. It's usually a couple of core developers doing the bulk of the work.

**Dominance**: Represents the total percentage of commits by CoreDev(s)  
**CoreDev**: The developer(s) that does the bulk of coding in a project  
**Contributors**: The total number of developers that has contributed to a project   

Being a core developer on a big project is so much more than hammering out features. As a project matures core developers will be responsible for reviewing pull requests, managing personal and external open-source projects that are used in the day to day business. Staying up to date with convention,  porting projects and it's dependencies to support the latest language API changes, writing blog posts about methodologies in order to understand them better. Writing demo projects to test new theories. Please cut them some slack if they take a bit of extra time when coding a one off submodule or a like. Their head may be a bit dispersed and they may not be as quick as a rookie developer with nothing on their plate. Doesn't make them  outdated or past their prime. Apples and oranges. üçèüçä
