### Collaboration
Prefer asyncronus collaboration over syncranous. as work becomes ever more complex and deep. humans need less shallow focus and that means less interuption. Github handles this quite elegantly through issues. where one has to take care and be succinct in both asking and answerigng. Github recently also added edit history so one can investigate original q/a which encourage even more carefulness and less wasted bandwidth.

### Colaboration
Github is all about insentives collaboration. Spending time on the mundane and impactfull over the exiting and noticable but ultimaly only adds feature creeep and complexity of the product. 

### Collaboration
If we are being honist with our selfs, collaboration is hard. Look at most of almost all of the top repositories on github from apple/swift to alamofire etc. They all have a 1 or 2 core developers coding 90% of the code. On the surface this is true even for something as complex as apple/swift Even though there is 4-5 people with the bulk of the commits, if you divide it up in time periods there is 1 or 2 guys doing the majority of the code. Chris latner soley in the begining. Even huge opensource project such as github/atom which has 100s of contributers it usualy a couple of core developers doing the bulk of the work. 

Being a core developer on a big project is so much more than hammering out features. As a project matures core developers will be responsible for reviewing pull requests, managing personal and external opensource projects that are used in the day to day business. Staying uptodate with convention,  porting projects and its dependencies to support the latest language api changes, writing blog posts about methodologies in order to understand them better. Writing demo projects to test new theories. The list goes on.
