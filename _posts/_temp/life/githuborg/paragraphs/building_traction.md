### Slow traction 
Build something epic and they will come they say. On the contrary, Sindre Sorhus as built a reputation for building software over time. Slowly building traction and publicity around what he builds. Meticulously churning out small improvments to obscure modules that make up the array of digital products he now posses on his github profile. Popularity and success are properties that usually arrive very asymetrically. Sindre has understood that many small streams can form a big river. Everything that he codes adds to the overall feedback loop of his entire hyper organization, spanning 100s of developers from all over the world chipping in for free, all the while he masterfully manages it all on github from a cafe in Thailand. 

Understood that products doesnt have to be shipped when they are ready, but are shipped over time

 Bit bucket and gitlab feels uninspiring and closed of. And does not foster the instrimsic motivation humans needs to push things forward.
