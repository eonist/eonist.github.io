### Core developer syndrom 
If we are being honist with our selfs, collaboration is hard. Look at most of almost all of the top repositories on github from apple/swift to alamofire etc. They all have a 1 or 2 core developers coding 90% of the code. On the surfacethis is true even for something as complex as apple/swift Even though there is 4-5 people with the bulk of the commits, if you divide it up in time periods there is 1 or 2 guys doing the majority of the code. Chris latner soley in the begining. Even huge opensource project such as github/atom which has 100s of contributers it usualy a couple of core developers doing the bulk of the work. 

Being a core developer on a big project is so much more than hammering out features. reviewing pull requests, managing personal and external opensource projects that are used in the day to day business. Staying uptodate with convention,  porting projects and its dependencies to support the latest language api changes, writing blog posts about methodologies in order to understand them better. Writing demo projects to test new theories. The list goes on
