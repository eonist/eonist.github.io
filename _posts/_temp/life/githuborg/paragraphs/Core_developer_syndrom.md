### Core developer syndrom 
If we are being honist with our selfs, collaboration is hard. Look at most of almost all of the top repositories on github from apple/swift to alamofire etc. They all have a 1 or 2 core developers coding 90% of the code. On the surfacethis is true even for something as complex as apple/swift Even though there is 4-5 people with the bulk of the commits, if you divide it up in time periods there is 1 or 2 guys doing the majority of the code. Chris latner soley in the begining. Even huge opensource project such as github/atom which has 100s of contributers it usualy a couple of core developers doing the bulk of the work.
