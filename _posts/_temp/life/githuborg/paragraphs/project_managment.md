### Project managment on github
Managing the product development on github is crucial because it highlights what core developers are working on. On the surface make feature X and Y may seem trivial but to acomplish it issued must be solved, dependecies has to be tested and updated. CI tests have to be written, Issues must be discussed and Documentation must be written. It may very well be that in the end it takes 4 weeks instead of 2. But the crucial part is that there is a paper-trail of why and how it took twice the time that was budget. Interacting with the complex nature of software projects is not the same as time budgeting painting a wall or installing a new kitchen. Sure you can always power though it and build something that resembles the spec, but not with out corrupting the overall product / code quality. Do this enough times and your left with an intertwined pile of unusable code. That is impossible to improve or even roll back because dependencies moved on.


In this day and age where products are getting ever more complex to the extent that they are almost living entities of their own. 



If your going to run a software company, you better be prepared to run it on the premise of the developers that are building it and the platform where it’s being built. Managers love google suite, but developers don’t, and ingarantuee that developers has less down time to spare than managers and support staff. Developers usually operate at 100% cognition where as managers often has a lot of down time between meetings and organisational work.
And don’t have time to waste on fragile and haphazard  “collaboration”  platform that is in flavour this week.
