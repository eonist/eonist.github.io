### Asymmetrical success ü¶Ñ
Build something epic and they will come. On the contrary, Sindre Sorhus as built a reputation for building software over time. slowly building traction and publicity around what he makes. Meticulously churning out small improvements to obscure modules that makes up the array of digital products he now manage in his github profile. Sindre has understood that products doesn't have to be shipped when they are ready, but are rather shipped over time, with live feed-back as [bugs present them selfs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gifski-app/issues/40). Popularity and success are properties that usually arrive very asymmetrically. Sindre has understood that many small streams can form a big river. His currently at nr.13 on the [global-github leader-board](http://git-awards.com/users) in front of Trillion dollar conglomerates such as Apple, Microsoft and Google. Everything that he codes/writes/supports adds to the overall feedback loop of his umbrella organization, spanning 100s of developers from all over the world chipping in for free, all the while he masterfully manages it all on github usually from a cafe in Thailand. üèùüçπ

### The most important feature is trust ü§û
Building a github profile is also about trust. Would you rather use a free closed source app from a random developer on the AppStore. Or would you use an OSS app from github by sindre sorhus, which depends on maintain his reputation that he has built over many years, and if where broken could probably never rebuild again. In this day an age where it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to make money from apps many devs are tempted to syphon a little private information or even worse install backdoors or spam-ware.

### Shipping to stay relevant üöÄ 
With AI on the horizon and a shrinking pool of available jobs. Maintaining a relevant github profile is more important than ever. Technology moves faster and faster and people that stops shipping relevant projects will be replaced by someone with more relevant abilities. There is a theory floating around that humanity will come up with new jobs once the superfluous jobs disappear. I guess time will tell, but in the mean time staying relevant is all we can do.
