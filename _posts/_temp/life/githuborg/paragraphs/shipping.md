### Asymmetrical success 
Build something epic and they will come they say. On the contrary, Sindre Sorhus as built a reputation for building software over time. Slowly building traction and publicity around what he builds. Meticulously churning out small improvments to obscure modules that make up the array of digital products he now posses in his github profile. Popularity and success are properties that usually arrive very asymmetrically. Sindre has understood that many small streams can form a big river. Everything that he codes/writes/supports adds to the overall feedback loop of his umbrella organization, spanning 100s of developers from all over the world chipping in for free, all the while he masterfully manages it all on github usually from a cafe in Thailand. üèùüçπ

Understood that products doesnt have to be shipped when they are ready, but are shipped over time

 Bit bucket and gitlab feels uninspiring and closed of. And does not foster the instrimsic motivation humans needs to push things forward.
 


 ### Shipping
 Forget linkdin. Linkdin is for careerists and hierarchy climbers, who spent way to much on university Tuition and needs to recoup some of the wasted money. It‚Äôs a cees pool of past tense. Linkdin is a bunch of fancy titles and entitlments. Great so you where a CTO at company XYZ and devloped inovative solutions for years. Then how come when I visit your github profile there is no evidence of this brilliance, nothing that stands out, just a bunch of unedited forks. An active github profile says something about a developers ability to ship. 
 
 
 ### Shipping products to stay relevant
 Maintiang a relevant github profile is vital if you want to stay attrative in the job market. Technology moves faster and faster and people that stops shipping relevant projects may be replaced by someone with uptodate abilities.
