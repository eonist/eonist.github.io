### Digital tool belt
You can create a digital product on string budget. But in my opinion you can save a lot of money by joining the SaaS eco system and paying for services that will save you time. Definitely bootstrap the MVP and ship the product to market. But once you start to form a company. Suddenly you become dependent on creating a culture that can produce high quality code. At which point its vital to re-strap and pay for a few services that will give your developers super powers. It could mean paying 25$-100$ monthly for services but it would enable your developer team of 2-3 people to do the job of 5-6 developers. 

My modest personal service/bot budget consists of: Codebeat 20$ month, Github 7$ month, circle CI 39$ a month. I use this service to help maintain the code quality of projects i maintain and also so that I am update and have the in-depth knowledge of how to operate these services for external clients. Small cost, high impact for both my self and companies I work for. If your more than one developer on a team it's crucial to invest in CI (Continues integration). No more: but it compiles on my machine. In this day and age almost 100% of our work is possible to do asynchronously. And as such, work that your team mates push should not be able to break CI. If it does than it also breaks everyones work and can cause delays and bottle necks. Github currently has CI support for both pull requests and commits.
