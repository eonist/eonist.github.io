Different people have different motivators. Some are motivated by money, some are founders at startups and are motivated by getting their business sold and cashing out. Most likley your a regular employee at a company doing what you can to help the company excell. I have a few friends at google and with out exception they all dream of branching out on their own venture, but at the end of the day that efty paycheck is keeping them tied up. 

IN my opinion encouraging employees to write opensource modules has a great effect on the productline for your company and the motivation of the emplyee. The dymaics is something like this: Employees that are allowed to write opensource modules just care more about what they are building, they have a stake in the overarching outcome of the company that is beyond money. 

Github fosters to team culture. Quality code. Github motivates you to get up in the morning and write a test for things you know no one is going to care about. At least you can opensource it and maybe get some exposure and interest from other developers. Maybe even land your next job. 


Github's infamous commit-graph streaks also motivates you to keep hustling. I totally respect devs who has blanks for saturday and sundays. To be honist whenever i see that i think the world is a better place. 


Ideas an products are fueled by dreams and aspirations. A motivated developer has a lot more impact on a product than trying to save 25$ a month.
