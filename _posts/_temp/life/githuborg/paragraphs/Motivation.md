### Satisfation
Committing code is a little like chopping wood. After a long and sweaty day among trees, struggling with bugs and tooling that fails you when you least expect it, you finally see the result as a stack of lumber, which closley translates to a stack of commits in the digital realm. One on piece of wood stacked on top of the other. It's a satisifying sight to behold. Some lumps are torny and still have twigs sticking out. Similar to how some commits are rough around the edges and could be improved with some pruning. The end result of your hard work is visble to the naked eye, and you have something to show for your hard work, something to show managment, co workers and your self. A chunk of work written into the history of the project, something tangible that says something about who you are, what choices you made, what shortcuts where taken and exactly how much elbow grease you put into it. 2 weeks of work that can be investigated, probably something you wont be proud of 2 years from now but that doesn't matter. The work is there for your entire company to see and it will fuel your motivation in next endevour you take on. Sometimes your work is apploauded other times its critizised and improvments are suggested by your colegues and peers. Yet other times you can feel like your head is always tipping under water, and your struggeling to breath because the tasks keep coming in and your having trouble finding a foothold to keep up with the ever increasing complexity and scope. Estimating tasks starts to become difficult, but by using the commit history and pull-request comment threads from the last completed task you are able to give a more accurate estimate. Maybe there were bottlenecks you had to overcome like happened in commit id: `dv7e22` and also in `ku3ce`. Estimates are complex, and are increasing in complexity as a project grows. Simply asking for estimates doesn't cut it anymore. Managment has to be integrated in to the platform where the work happens, not simply be asigners and time keepers. Non-techinical managers needs to keep up with the times and learn how to look under the hood (aka read commit descriptions) and be able to understand consequences of organizational friction and how "feature creep" has a tendency to lead to bottlenecks when developing software. The image bellow is from my recent experience with wood chopping. I estimated id complete it in a weekend, but in the end it took 10 days. Doing something the first time always takes longer than you expect, but everytime I walk by it It feels satisfying to look at. ðŸ’ª

### Incentivizing tasks
Stackoverflow is great. It incentives people to help other people on the off chance that someone in the future may upvote your the effort to help. Every time I need to look up some code related issue i fire up chrome with stackoverflow and see if I can find something related to my code question. Sometimes there is a little green flag that indicates a few of my previous answers has been upvoted since i last visited the site. And other times there is a red flag indicating that someone has aditional questions, maybe I have to adjust one of my answers to reflect recent API change etc. stackoverflow isnt with out flaws, there is no incentive to change previouse answers by other people that clearly needs an update, People are rather incentivesed to add new answers of their own, often duplicates of previous answers. and as a result you end up with slightly different variations of the same answer. Instead one could have just updated the original answer.but since there is no upvotes to be gained for edits and since no one will ever know you updated the answer. People simple avoid doing things that are not noticed or adds up to their personal prosperity. 

### Product ownership
Organizing your product development on github also highlights who does what, and their impact on what is being made. Parts of the product can be branched of to opensource mini projects that emplyees can be "product-owners" of. There is empircal eveidence that so called product owners are order of magnitudes more productive than emplyees that dont feel any ownership. even if that ownership is ephemeral and limited in time, the likleyhood of a better outcome is 10x higher than if product ownership is fleeting and watered down between individuals. People just dont care about products they dont get credit for. As a piece of ancidotal evidence take spotify as an example. Spotify has begun making job ads with Digital productowner in the title. because they expereince employees feeling dissatisfied in their working condition and are leaving for other more satisifing ventures where they can get more credit for their efforts. Its also evident in spotifys productline. Take the webplayer for instance. Even something as basic and simple as pressing the play button doesnt work. You have to press it over and over, often refreshing the browser, and waiting a long time until it finally playes the wrong song. How hard can it be? why are they not fixing this simple issue? As It turns out the inter organization ticketing system isnt working. To fix the issue you have to coordinate who ever made the webplayer interface and then who ever made the mobile player. because the mobile player needs to be pause to make it possible for the the desktop player to start. Because its neat feature that they interact. If it worked. So now you have two units that has to coordinate to fix a problem that is pretty trivial. But the units are busy on project XYZ that are more important for their career and personal outcome. and so are not motivated to fix the issue. so it remains unsolved until the next batch of emplyees re-write the webapp. 

### Code debt backlogs
One has to ask. If this was my personal codebase on a personal project what would I prioritize coding? The mundane issue that improves the stability of the app and has exponantial value in simplifying further coding, but that no one vivisibly notice or knows about? or adding new flashy features that management understands and can visibly see. Something that feels like progress. On a personal project the former is a no brainer. On collaborative projects the latter 99% of the time gets prioritized, because visible progress. never mind the 100+ backlog issues and code debt. A worry for another time. until the codebase crawls to a stop not even updating a simple style is possible without weeks/months of effort. 


### Running a tight ship
creating an issue, and trying to solve it. sometimes some strange bug can take a while to resolve. highligthing why what and when is key to explaining why the other deliverables are late. causuality. but its allabpart of a good keeping a tight ship. and good grounds keeping. its also about leaving  a papertrail. when managment get a bit too exuberant and ask a bit too much, and you as a dev dont want to be a party stopper and go with the flow. maybe you cant finish what they ask, but maybe just starting something is gd enough, and then leave it up to managment to invest more into to it. 


#### Opensource as motivation
In my opinion encouraging employees to write opensource modules has a great effect on the productline for your company and the motivation of the emplyee. The dymaics is something like this: Employees that are allowed to write opensource modules just care more about what they are building, they have a stake in the overarching outcome of the company that is beyond money. Different people have different motivators. Some are actually motivated by money, some are founders at startups and are motivated by getting their business sold and cashing out. Most likley your a regular employee at a company doing what you can to help the company excel. Humans are usually driven by small incentives and dreams. In a sense Github motivates you to get up in the morning and write a test for things you know no one is going to care about. At least you can open-source it and maybe get some exposure and interest from other developers. Maybe even land your next job. Github's infamous commit-graph streaks also motivates you to keep hustling. I totally respect devs who has blanks for saturday and sundays like [Josh Harber](https://github.com/joshaber) . To be honest whenever I see that i think the world is a better place. Ideas are fueled by dreams and aspirations. A motivated developer has a lot more impact than someone that is there just for the sake of having a job. Thats why its really important that developers are included when the concept is created. Instead of just being given tasks from top down. It should rather be the developer that assigns him self tasks.
