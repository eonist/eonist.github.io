Being a core developer on a big project is so much more than hammering out features. reviewing pull requests, managing personal and external opensource projects that are used in the day to day business. Staying uptodate with convention,  porting projects and its dependencies to support the latest language api changes, writing blog posts about methodologies in order to understand them. Writing demo projects to test new theories. 


//100% of my time on github, call me a native github, i manage my career on github as oppose to linkdin. I get most of my freelance inqueries and job oppertunity as a result of my visibility on github. Frankly github is what puts bread on the table. 
Just like dribbble is alpha omega for a designer to display their work and musicians uploading their songs to soundcloud, so is github for developers. Is your work impactful? Do you write with the highest standard of the industry? Sure education, work experience and network still count, to a degree, but its probably only a matter of time before CI quality unbiased quality bots are applied to student exams. Imagine students getting a grade seconds after they "commit" their exam. Ai bots analysing meaning, grammar, impactfullness and degree of plagarism on the fly. 


I recently joined a tech company in Oslo. Great people, great idea. And great hustling spirit. And thus they try to save wherever they can. Which is a good thing. As such they try to use free services whereever they can. Google docs for pdf sahring, slack for communication, asana for issue tracking and task assignment, bitbucker for private code repos and github for public repos. All adding up to the cost of zero $. However there is a hidden cost attached, namly complexity and lost oppertunity. 

You can create a digital product on string budget. But in my opinion you can save a lot of money by joining the SaaS eco system and paying for services that will save you time. Definitly bootstrap the MVP and ship the product to market. But once you start a company and are dependent on creating a culture for producing code of high quality, then its time to re-strap and pay for a few services that will give your developers super powers. It could mean paying 25$-100$ monthly for services but it would enable your developer team of 2-3 people to do the job of 5-6 developers. 

### Minimum Personal SaaS budget
My modest personal service/bot budget toolbelt looks something like this:Codebeat 20$ month, Github 7$ month, circle CI 39$ a month. I use this service to help maintain the code quality of the projects and also so that I am updote and have the in-depth knowledge of how to operate these services in a professional context. Small cost, high impact for my self and for companies I work for. 

### Minumum Profecional SaaS budget
If your more than one developer on a team its crucial to invest in Continues intigration. No more but it compiles on my maschine. In this day and age almost 1005 OUR WORK is possible to do asyncronasly. And as such work that your team mates push should not be able to break CI. If it does than it also breaks everyones work and casuses bottle necks. Github has CI integration for pullrequests and commits. 

The cost of poor code quality. 
Its rummoured that microsfot is launching a new phone os, which they have spent years developing with a huge team, but its most likley being cancled because the overall code quality is so bad that its beyond saving. 

80% is maintinance/code improve 2+% is new features. yet many projects think of software as 1++% building

### Colaboration
Github is all about insentives collaboration. Spending time on the mundane and impactfull over the exiting and noticable but ultimaly only adds feature creeep and complexity of the product. 

### Core developer syndrom 
If we are being honist with our selfs, collaboration is hard. Look at most of almost all of the top repositories on github from apple/swift to alamofire etc. They all have a 1 or 2 core developers coding 90% of the code. On the surfacethis is true even for something as complex as apple/swift Even though there is 4-5 people with the bulk of the commits, if you divide it up in time periods there is 1 or 2 guys doing the majority of the code. Chris latner soley in the begining. Even huge opensource project such as github/atom which has 100s of contributers it usualy a couple of core developers doing the blunt of the work. 


If you compare feature by feature it may seem odd to fork over pay 25$ for github org account. 


For me github offers much more than an a cloud git service. 


Ideas an products are fueled by dreams and aspirations. A motivated developer has a lot more impact on a product than trying to save 25$ a month.

Github fosters to team culture. Quality code. Github motivates you to get up in the morning and write a test for things you know no one is going to care about. At least you can opensource it and maybe get some stars or interest from other developers. Maybe even land your next job. 

Github's infamous commit-graph streaks also motivates you to keep hustling. I totally respect devs who has blanks for saturday and sundays. To be honist whenever i see that i think the world is a better place. 

Github also offers tracking features such as insight, where you can see where trafic is comming from the internet, or if your co-workers really reviewed the code or not. 

Github isnt just a great git service, its also an always on convention center displaying your prowness and previouse digital products you have made. There is nothing that motivates a developer more than creating something in the open, getting feedback on your creation, growing your profeccional skills on the way. ascending to different places in life. Or not, sometimes products totally fails in the market, but thats ok. Its all about trying the unlikley and keep getting experience. 

Different people have different motivators. Some are motivated by money, some are founders at startups and are motivated by getting their business sold and cashing out. Most likley your a regular employee at a company doing what you can to help the company excell. I have a few friends at google and with out exception they all dream of branching out on their own venture, but at the end of the day that efty paycheck is keeping them tied up. 

IN my opinion encouraging employees to write opensource modules has a great effect on the productline for your company and the motivation of the emplyee. The dymaics is something like this: Employees that are allowed to write opensource modules just care more about what they are building, they have a stake in the overarching outcome of the company that is beyond money. 

Organizing your product development on github also highlights who does what, and their impact on what is being made. Parts of the product can be branched of to opensource mini projects that emplyees can be product owners of. There is empircal eveidence that so called product owners are order of magnitudes more productive than emplyees that dont feel any ownership. even if that ownership is virtual and limited in time, the likleyhood of a better outcome is 10x higher than if product ownership are fleeting and water down. People just dont care about products they dont get credit for. As ancidotal evidence take spotify as an example. Spotify has begun making job adds with Digital productowner in the title. because they expereince employees feeling dissatisfied in their working condition and are leaving for other more satisifing ventures. Its also evident in spotifys productline. Take the webplayer for instance. Even something as basic and simple as pressing the play button doesnt work. You have to press it over and over, often refreshing the browser, and waiting a long time until it finally playes the wrong song. How hard can it be? why are they not fixing this simple issue? As It turns out the inter organization ticketing system isnt working. To fix the issue you have to coordinate who ever made the webplayer interface and then who ever made the mobile player. because the mobile player needs to be pause to make it possible for the the desktop player to start. Because its neat feature that they interact. If it worked. So now you have two unites that has to coordinate to fix a problem that is pretty trivial. But the unites are busy on project XYZ that are more important for their career and personal outcome. and so are not motivated to fix the issue. so it remains unsolved until the next batch of emplyees re-write the webapp. 

The power of having everything under one roof. A workflow I enjoy on github is storing .gif .jpg and even .svg directly in a repo and using urls similar to https://rawgit.com/repo-name/img/master/ and svgs via 


writing blog posts about processes, code tech, updating your skills , participating in the coding scdne / sphere

fixing code that managment isnt sanctioning alotting time for 

ci-travis code-climate pull-req bots

managers csn check where your focus is w/o becoming paranoid. Iys all in the github summary. maybe you fix an issue in a rdependencie your company repo uses. that would go unnoticed otherwise etc




its also about leaving  a papertrail. when managment get a bit too exuberant and ask a bit too much, and you as a dev dont want to be a party stopper and go with the flow. maybe you cant finish what they ask, but maybe just starting something is gd enough, and then leave it up to managment to invest more into to it. 

creating an issue, and trying to solve it. sometimes some strange bug can take a while to resolve. highligthing why what and when is key to explaining why the other deliverables are late. causuality.but its allabpart of a good keeping a tight ship. and good grounds keeping. 




i recently joined an exciting mobile app startup in Oslo. Great people, great idea, but lackluster excecution. The codebase had no structure which was due to inexperience and irresponsible developers. No culture for producing high quality code. No infrastructure to build a high quality code culture. 3 years in and their code should have been tossed 2 years ago when it was last updated in a meaningfull way. the last two years it had been in lifesupport mode piling on more and more features without fixing crusial breaking issues. I dont have any indepth information why it had become this way, but i can speculate that it was because there simply wasnt any incentive to fix issues. It was more encouraged to add sexy features even though that app crashed on the simplest operation. OFten right after you opened it. 


Insentivicing tasks:


If tasks are not front and center, if no one knows


//write about 4 apps into 1

//write about how issues dont translate to github from bitbucket. 

//write about intertiwness of keeping everything in one place and adding markdown links to PR's that fix such issues. 

### A github for everyone
Maybe someone on your team that isn't a developer discover a bug. Giving non developers access to github repos enables them to first check if a similar issue is already present, if not then create a github issue. Ask the core devs on the project, with @ tagging, if it can be fixed. Then the developers on the project will investigate the issue discussing urgency / priority / complexity and finally assigning a priority to the issue and then with @ tagging politly ask if someone has time to solve it, . If the issues piles up and there are tens or hundreds of issues, then its probably a good sign that the codebase is lacking code quality or lack of allocated time for maintance of the codebase. Once an issue is fixed, the issue is closed and a link to the Pull-requst that fixed the problem is added to the bottom of the issue. Keeping a tight ship is make it or break it when your builidng complex software entities involving many people / teams / dependencies. The point of all this is that the problem is presented front and center, the issue finder gets credit for finding the issue, bonus points for adding a description about what led to the error. Who ever investigates the issue and finds additional information about the issue gets credit for time spent. 

Let everyone be involved in making the product, its infinity more rewarding helping building something if its noticed and the effort is recorded and timestamped in the commit history of the project. In my opinion everyone on the team should have read and write access to all projects on github. If someone comes up with a feature that should be added then this can be added as a feature request in issue. Tagged feature or enhancement. Adding feature as issues also has the added effect that people cant request the idea twice, because it would already be added and closed. 

Finally github coupeling the project. Issues can have link pointers to PR's that solve them, PR's can have links to wiki posts that explain the rational behind the PullRequst. Wikipages can have links to design assets in other repositories in the github organization etc. Or API documentation. Everything stored as markdown which is easily editable with full commit history of who added/edited what. 

Everything that is relevant for the project. API documentation readme files, UX / Design assets, Beause everything on github allows team-mates to comment and discuss changes and additions. Involving the coders in the design process of features and products are crucial when it comes to calculating the liklyhood of its accomplishable or not. Not involving the person that is finally going to be making the product is a recipe for disastaster both in terms of motivation and in terms of gauging excepectations and timeframe of completion. 

### Project managment on github
Managing the product development on github is crucial because it highlights what core developers are working on. On the surface make feature X and Y may seem trivial but to acomplish it issued must be solved, dependecies has to be tested and updated. CI tests have to be written, Issues must be discussed and Documentation must be written. It may very well be that in the end it takes 4 weeks instead of 2. But the crucial part is that there is a paper-trail of why and how it took twice the time that was budget. Interacting with the complex nature of software projects is not the same as time budgeting painting a wall or installing a new kitchen. Sure you can always power though it and build something that resembles the spec, but not with out corrupting the overall product / code quality. Do this enough times and your left with an intertwined pile of unusable code. That is impossible to improve or even roll back because dependencies moved on.


In this day and age where products are getting ever more complex to the extent that they are almost living entities of their own. 


### Simplifying complexity
Keeping documentation where the projects are built. Instead of putting documents on google, api instructions on slack , UX pdfs on a google drive, and issues in asana. One should rather collect it in the place where the digital product is being built. Github cateres to all the needs described above. Documents can be collaborativly written in the wiki section, complete with commit history et al. Issues should be documented and discussed in the issue section. Design assets can be version controlled in its own repo instead of in emails / dropbox. The great thing about collaborating on github is that no resolution is lost, all effort is version controlled. Its also the industry standard when it comes to building software so everyone (should) know it as if it was the back of their hand. Also requires markdown skills. takes a few minutes to learn the basics and is alot of fun to master ;) 


### Incentivisng tasks
Stackoverflow is great it incentives people to help people by the off chance that someone in the future may upvote your the effort to aid. Everytime I need to look up some code related issue i fire up chrome with stackoverflow and see if I can find something related to my code question. Sometimes there is a litte green flag that indicates a few of my previouse answers has been upvoted since i last visited the site. And other times there is a red flag indicating that someone has aditional questions, maybe I have to adjust one of my answers to reflect recent API change etc. stackoverflow isnt with out flaws, there is no incentive to change previouse answers by other people that clearly needs an update, People are rather incentivesed to add new ansewers of their own, often duplicates of previous answers. and as a result you end up with slightly different variations of the same answer. Instead one could have just updated the original answer.but since there is no upvotes to be gained and since no one will ever know you updated the answer. People simple avoid doing things that are not noticed or adds up to their personal outcome. 







One has to ask. If this was my personal codebase on a personal project what would I prioritize coding? The mundane issue that improves the stability of the app and has exponantial value in simplifying further coding, but that no one vivisibly notice or knows about? or adding new features that management understands and can visibly see. Something that feels like progress. On a personal project the former is a no brainer. On collaborative projects the later 99% gets prioritized, because visible progress. nevermind the 100+ backlog issues and code debt. A worry for another time. until the codebase crawls to a stop not even updating a simple style is possible with days of effort. 


as h---z say it, software is eating the world. bwing active on github is also exelent carer managment showing recruiters and the world at large that your comitting impactfull code and contributing to opensource projects ina meaninful way.
