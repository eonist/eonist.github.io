My notes about github vs bitbucket<!--more-->. 


If you compare feature by feature it may seem odd to fork over pay 25$ for github org account. 


For me github offers much more than an a cloud git service. 


Ideas an products are fueled by dreams and aspirations. A motivated developer has a lot more impact on a product than trying to save 25$ a month.

Github fosters to team culture. Quality code. Github motivates you to get up in the morning and write a test for things you know no one is going to care about. At least you can opensource it and maybe get some stars or interest from other developers. Maybe even land your next job. 

Github's infamous commit-graph streaks also motivates you to keep hustling. I totally respect devs who has blanks for saturday and sundays. To be honist whenever i see that i think the world is a better place. 

Github also offers tracking features such as insight, where you can see where trafic is comming from the internet, or if your co-workers really reviewed the code or not. 

Github isnt just a great git service, its also an always on convention center displaying your prowness and previouse digital products you have made. There is nothing that motivates a developer more than creating something in the open, getting feedback on your creation, growing your profeccional skills on the way. ascending to different places in life. Or not, sometimes products totally fails in the market, but thats ok. Its all about trying the unlikley and keep getting experience. 

Different people have different motivators. Some are motivated by money, some are founders at startups and are motivated by getting their business sold and cashing out. Most likley your a regular employee at a company doing what you can to help the company excell. I have a few friends at google and with out exception they all dream of branching out on their own venture, but at the end of the day that efty paycheck is keeping them tied up. 

IN my opinion encouraging employees to write opensource modules has a great effect on the productline for your company and the motivation of the emplyee. The dymaics is something like this: Employees that are allowed to write opensource modules just care more about what they are building, they have a stake in the overarching outcome of the company that is beyond money. 

Organizing your product development on github also highlights who does what, and their impact on what is being made. Parts of the product can be branched of to opensource mini projects that emplyees can be product owners of. There is empircal eveidence that so called product owners are order of magnitudes more productive than emplyees that dont feel any ownership. even if that ownership is virtual and limited in time, the likleyhood of a better outcome is 10x higher than if product ownership are fleeting and water down. People just dont care about products they dont get credit for. As ancidotal evidence take spotify as an example. Spotify has begun making job adds with Digital productowner in the title. because they expereince employees feeling dissatisfied in their working condition and are leaving for other more satisifing ventures. Its also evident in spotifys productline. Take the webplayer for instance. Even something as basic and simple as pressing the play button doesnt work. You have to press it over and over, often refreshing the browser, and waiting a long time until it finally playes the wrong song. How hard can it be? why are they not fixing this simple issue? As It turns out the inter organization ticketing system isnt working. To fix the issue you have to coordinate who ever made the webplayer interface and then who ever made the mobile player. because the mobile player needs to be pause to make it possible for the the desktop player to start. Because its neat feature that they interact. If it worked. So now you have two unites that has to coordinate to fix a problem that is pretty trivial. But the unites are busy on project XYZ that are more important for their career and personal outcome. and so are not motivated to fix the issue. so it remains unsolved until the next batch of emplyees re-write the webapp. 

The power of having everything under one roof. A workflow I enjoy on github is storing .gif .jpg and even .svg directly in a repo and using urls similar to https://rawgit.com/repo-name/img/master/ and svgs via 


writing blog posts about processes, code tech, updating your skills , participating in the coding scdne / sphere

fixing code that managment isnt sanctioning alotting time for 

ci-travis code-climate pull-req bots

managers csn check where your focus is w/o becoming paranoid. Iys all in the github summary. maybe you fix an issue in a rdependencie your company repo uses. that would go unnoticed otherwise etc
