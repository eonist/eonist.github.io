### Researching the hidden (The art of figuring out whats relevant)

1. Define your question. usually the question can be formulated in one sentence. But to solve it there is a huge hierarchy of pieces that make up the final answer. Take `E=MC2` for instance. The answer is elegant. But under it there are many nodes of theories. Try to figure out what the bounds of the final answer will be. To avoid getting sucked into something that is totally out of scope and way to resource/time consuming.

2. Is there related information that can confirm that your question can be answered. The more related information there is the more likely there is an answer.

3. Are there related similar theories? The lack of related information is usually an indicator that there is no answer to this question or that its an undiscovered gem waiting to be found. Try to be realistic, most likely there just isn't an answer if there is little related information.

4. Try isolated experiments to make your mind more absorbent to the correct hunches. It's all a process of elimination and the more things you can eliminate that it isn't the easier it will be to piece together the final solution. One less unknown at the time. Divide and conquer.

5. Try for the simplest cases. Do mini experiments to confirm or disconfirm hunches. `Disconfirm: show that (a belief or hypothesis) is not or may not be true.`

6. Try your behemoth theory from time to time. But if it doesn't work. Keep trying the simplest experiments. Your mind will just keep getting more absorbent to the sort of gotchas that will lead to the correct answer. The trick is to soak your brain in as much relevant and related information as possible in a short amount of time.

7. Force your self to try over and over until it works. Don't quit. this is not everyday. You do this now and then. Your brain can take it. go 20h straight if you must. If you quit and call it for the night, your brain will shed the mini gotchas you just picked up in the research frenzy you just did. Your brain is like a swamp, over time the water/information will excpell and evaporate. You have to nail this in the now. Think of it as a hackathon. When you nail it. It's done. You can relax and refine your answer and make it perfect. This next period is pure heaven and you can really enjoy it. But until then your life is hell. Sorry. No way around this.

8. Keep trying. Envelope your mind in the quest for the answer. Consume your self. But don't let weeks/months go by. If you keep hitting the wall. write down your findings and gather more in-depth information. Write a white-paper to straighten your mind. Ask others for an opinion on your white-paper. Do more deep research into peripheral references etc.

9. Sometimes the final answer is a set of 4-5 gotchas that combine into an elegant answer. But among 20-40 similar plausible gotchas you find while researching, there is an all most infinite sea of combinations. to unlock the final combination you have to use the human intuition. In the beginning only 1 or 2 gotachas work. after many attempts 2-3 start to work and you only need to fit that last gotcha. This is usually the hardest part so keep at it. The more you work on it and read the better your intuition for picking the right combination of gotachs will be.

10. Works every time: Go for a walk if your stuck. The brain needs oxygen. Also walking and letting your brain think about simpler things helps it re-adjust and recover from all the illogic connections you have attempted the last few hours. Winter time is great for putting on a wooly coat and going for a stroll. While you literally cool your head for a bit.

### Tips:
1. If you have to research something over many days. It's helpful to write down a manifesto of your findings. That you can review now and then to avoid making your brain all mixed. You need to force your brain to try the illogical but sometimes you need to stop being illogical and straighten it out again. Figuratively speaking.

2. Eat food with lots of fat. Walnuts, milk products, meat etc. The brain consume lots of calories when it's thinking hard. Indulge. yes you'll gain weight. But this isn't forever. It's a short amount of time. Also you need to move around a lot to let oxygen flow to your brain so you shouldn't gain that much weight.

3. Investing in mini experiments that may lead no where feels like a waste of time for 99% of humanity. People hate to lose, even tiny amounts even when the payout can be huge. Its why most people do poor in the stockmarket, they are bias to not be the sucker. But statistically if you make many small bets that can make you look like a fool but win out huge, you'll come out way better than making big bets that can win little. So forcing your self to take the loss is an underestimated skill. Work is investment in time. Research is investment in time. Invest small amounts of time to be able to win that mother load.

4. The best researchers in the world are the ones that can enter a field they have little to zero pre-knowledge about and still find solutions. We live in a world where the best investigators often out preform field experts simply by being very adept at finding and piecing together solutions.

### Warning:
Don't do this kind of intense research everyday. Or you wont be able to see the forest for the trees. You lose your mind and probably get less intelligent over time. If you race-drive a car too much it will deteriorate. But if you need to escape the police now and then, then go hit the turbo button. Do it once in a while. Then go back to regular problem solving. Where you solve mini problems until you've solved enough of them that it makes up a big solution.
