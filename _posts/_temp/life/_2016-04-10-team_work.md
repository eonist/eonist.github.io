I don't believe in pair programing when doing creative work.

Research gathering can be delegated between people.

Delegate responsibility areas. Ownership of code is important all other scenarios are too cognitively taxing. Think spatial relationships. 

Write great notes and share them.

Share all research findings in a stackoverflow like system were people can vote good answers up. 

Give your team ownership or suffer from conniving, personal strategising, rivalry etc. if your team owns your company they will have only one goal in mind, making their share worth more. Give them an even ownership stake. Be a musketeer. All for one and one for all. If you want to only give a small share consider hiring someone that is worth 33% when expanding your team from 2 to 3. That person you only wanted to give 2% can be hired as a freelancer or as an external company where they have their own ownership stake. Equally as much. Find partners that have the same musketeer philosophy as you have.
