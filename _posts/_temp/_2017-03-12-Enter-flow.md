On Entering flow<!--more--> 

### Prelude:
I **Don't** try to work hard or work as much as I can , I rather try to Enter Flow as many times as possible throughout the day. 
> Mini breaks helps to retain the flow highs. ☝️

I do not believe in systems to keep you in check, all systems are prisons. I rather believe that I need to be open to all input, wims i get through the day. Keep your door open to the world or you will work on sightly the wrong thing. <-link
I have two rules: Wear Noice cancelling headphones.🎧  
> And **Don't waste your flow time** on things that don't require flow. ☝️ 

### Bar-graph:
Create a nice diagram with emojis that symbolize flow peaks decorated w/ football, pizza, fruits etc...maybe. My flow chart..pun intended 🤣

### Final word:

Flows last usually around 1 H or less. The same reason why school hours are counted as 45Min. They 👀 knew about flow back-when as well. In truth I don't work more than 8H (8*💯). I just spread it out over 17Hours so that I peak more often, rather than try and peak 8 times inside 8 hours which is impossible. You only get max 3-4 peaks inside 8 hours. Regular office hours.
