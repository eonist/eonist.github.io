reach domain saturation when you keep bumping into things you already know.

link diving endlessly until you start reading the same thing over and over again

write down the obscure connections. Research these last. after you have reached domain saturation.

write down original connections between sub-domains. these can be vital in discovery of un thought of ideas.

Write down the most important sub-domains of the domain your trying to research. group these as best you can. to easily access them after sometime where your knowledge is not fresh.

I believe reaching domain saturation is a more useful utility than mind-maps. its better at deriving interesting connections and anlysis. forging real connections in your brain. minmaps are more shallow and does not forge deep connections in your brain. you can chase rabits down rabit holes when you do domain "saturation oriented research" if you do that with mindmaps it just gets to unweildly too broad. You can always create another subfolder in your tree list with out obfuscating the important sub domains.

doing your own research is also imortant because you more easily forge the brain connections need to analys further. as oppose to reading someone elses compendium.
