FDD for short <!--more--> 

## Notes:

- Works great for mature and fresh projects. 
- Very motivating
- Collaboration friendly
- Open-source project often encourage feature branches when asked for pull requests
- Easier to reason with than abstract fixes etc. 
- If you need to fix a bug in a complicated segment of code, its easier if one fix it while adding a feature, as one tend dive deeper into the code if one attempts to reshape it.
- Humans are like dogs, if we have an achievable uncomplicated goal we can run tirelessly to finish it, losing track of time and space.
