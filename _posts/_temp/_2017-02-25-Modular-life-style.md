## Modular life-style:

Iterating on an idea that [Thiago forte article](https://medium.com/praxis-blog/bending-the-curves-of-productivity-25edb268672f#.xg2s22css)  wrote about. Were instead of trying to accomplish task based on eod (end of day) you rather focus on working on modules of work. This way you don't have to shut your door on the rest of the world to get something done. Because people that isolate them selfs tend to work on slightly the wrong problem, where as thous that keep the door open doesn't get any work done.

## Modular tasks:
Create a few milestones of where you want to go. 
1. Awesome IPhone App  
2. Awesome Website for App
3. Create buzz around App


- Then create tasks around these milestones. The tasks should be easily achievable: `create UIList with 4 items`, as appose to Connect UICollectionView to SQLite database. The later task can be broken into many smaller tasks. The key here is to keep your task items really small. It should be trivial to solve them. More complex tasks should rather be a milestone.  

- The trick is to remove tasks as soon as they are complete. Don't store them. The same goes for milestones. Remove them entirely. You can also throw away undone tasks. If they weren't done then they weren't important enough. The end result is the only thing that matters not how you arrived there. 

- Try to keep your task list as low as possible. Between `0 and 3` is good. The milestones should be between `0 and 3`. 


## Live your life:
- By always having a few easy things todo it's way easier to actually get started and do them. And by having a small set of milestones it becomes easy to reason about why you are doing these tasks. 

- Don't worry about forgetting things, if they are important they will re-surface. This way you can open the door to the world and let external impressions enrich your life. Sit in a bar and drink a beer while you iterate on a task. You don't have to complete it. But you can try. If it fails, try again with intimate knowledge of your first try. 

- Get a new idea? just drop some tasks of your list and add the new idea. The old tasks will resurface if they are important. They are also probably embedded in the milestones. And will have to be dealt with in order to finish a milestone. 

## Final word:  
- The take away here is that by keeping things small and achievable you trick your mind into believing life is easy. 

- You also avoid structuring your life in a system. You need spontinuity, you need to go on offbeat research trips for things and ideas. 

- So why not live a life were these things are not discouraged by conformity. 

- This philosophy can be summarised with this notation: ``LifeStyle(MileStones:0..<3, Tasks:0..<3) == .happiness``
