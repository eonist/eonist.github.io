### The great filter theory

There is this theory called the great filter. Evolutionary theory. Each step in evolution single cell to multi cell. Stone to agro, agro to industrial. The next filter I feel is github. Like sure itâ€™s industrial to digital. But if digital then social fabrics has to change. See software you make once and never again. The great filter is the theory that the reason the cosmos is absent of life except earth is because no one gets past one of these filters to the ultimate goal of interstellar communication and travel. Opensource/github could be the thing that gets us past the final filter or we could just keep fighting and never get past the filter. The GF theory also states that we could also be past the final filter. Why is github so important? Answer: there is no entity having as much positive impact on the world right now as github. Opensource used to be mailing-lists and .zip files. A bug fix would take months to fix, years to propagate.


### Ledger of trust

There is a huge trust problem in software today. Apps that claim they are free upfront but really aren't, i'm looking at you in-app-purchase. Apps that steal your information. Apps that report back to mothership with out your consent. Obtrusive popups that try to sell other apps to you, even if you paid for the app already. Apps that you pay for but does a bait and switch a short time after and now asks for periodical payments, this is especially common with newly launched apps, after their initial sales high dry out they turn to subscription model to keep a-float. How is the consumer suppose to differentiate which apps are ethical and which are not? The solution is trust. If the consumer can quickly glans a trust ledger he can quickly make up his mind if the app is ethical. This trust ledger isn't the comments in app-store as they are designed for the app maker not the user. And can be easily gamed and curated to weed out bad comments.

The trust ledger must be a neutral part. Something that cant be gamed, curated or censored. What comes to mind is GitHub. GitHub is a Tree of trust. You can quickly assess if a developer is trust-worthy or not. As he can only build this trust over time. There are lots of users I would trust in a heart beat. People I know are not scammy and wouldn't risk their reputation over adding scammy components to their apps to earna  buck or two.


### Tower of Babylon syndrome

I think you need a reset. Instead of making ever longer todo list. Just start over, with the intimate knowledge of your first attempt. This time keep it simple. Life is about being open to the chances that is presented for you. If you are busy all the time you'll miss out on all these opportunities that wooosh by. Not even knowing they past you.

I think all people/companies need to reset / re-evaluate what the heck they are doing more often. We build up this huge clusters of obligations, when we really should be simplifying and meaking a leaner life / company.

Expand on the subject: existential rest

Expand on the babylonians greed etc.


### Peacocks feather syndrome
The need to make something with wow factor and in the process just ending up with something contrived, instead of just solving the problem.

### Idea bin:
- IconMaker.app -> A drag and drop icon creator made with swift commandline + that flower pot icon ðŸ‘ˆ
- Compendium a dead simple .md -> pdf book converter
- Thermostat (Optional name: Cyclon)
- Radar (Open source "network guard" for your mac)
- GUI app for SPM
- Opensource hiring bot that checks your opensource skills
- Distil.io github contrib system for book synopsises
- A fin tech SaaS that recommends small bets that are improbable but may yield big. blackswans

### Ethical apps:
- The entire stack must be open-source
- The app must be possible to build from source
- If the app is distributed from an app store the sha-1 must match the sha-1 you can build your self
- External logging must be limited and if used completly transparant.
- No monkey business

### We all live in bubbles
We all live in bubbles of our own reality. We create this comfortable belief system to keep us a float. Escape the bubble!
