# Things to consider:
- Thinking about the problem / problems you have before you start to program a feature
- Pseudo coding to uncover potential roadblocks with out getting too entangled with production code and its limitations etc
- Iterating on the pseudo-code, even starting over, with the intimate knowledge of your first attempt
- Programming in an isolated module with fake data
- Slowly adding the module into the mothership code
- This way even if it doesn't work well in the mothership code, you can try again with another module with the same API and attach it to the mothership.
- This way you avoid growing the mothership out of control

### Holistically:
- When deciding to go for a solution, try to be the 10th man, the devils advocate, scrutinise the harmony of the decision. Going for a solution could eat up a lot of scare time/resources
- Could there be better approaches, simpler solutions, that are less costly on resource / time
