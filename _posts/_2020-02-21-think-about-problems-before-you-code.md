My notes regarding thinking about the problem before you start coding<!--more-->

## Things to consider:
- Take time to think about the problem or problems you're trying to solve before you start coding a feature.
- Do some research to see what's already out there and what solutions have been tried before.
- Use pseudo code to uncover potential roadblocks without getting too entangled with production code and its limitations.
- Iterate on the pseudo code, even starting over, with the intimate knowledge gained from your first attempt.
- Program in an isolated module with fake data to test your solution before integrating it into the main codebase.
- Problems are often easier to reason about in a new and pristine project, rather than a large, complex codebase where you have to constantly watch out for pitfalls and rabbit holes.
- If your solution doesn't work well in the main codebase, try again with another module that has the same API and attach it to the main codebase. This way, you can avoid growing the main codebase out of control.

## Holistically:
- When deciding on a solution, try to be the 10th man or devil's advocate and scrutinize the harmony of the decision. Going for a solution could eat up a lot of scarce time and resources.
- Consider whether there could be better approaches or simpler solutions that are less costly in terms of time and resources.
