> Bitcoin is digital gold that provides inflation protection

## Introduction:
Mining bitcoin is about getting 3 things right:
1. Sourcing efficient hardware
2. Sourcing cheap capital to scale
3. Sourcing cheap electricity

**Other lesser important factors include:**
- Hedging the future, researching and analysing whats next and mitigating risks before they happen. Sourcing / seeling HW. Diversifying crypto, creating backup plans, having multiple locations around the world. Arranging optimal shipping and security prices
- Stable geo-politic climate
- Running on low cost
- Skilled staff, fixing/swapping broken circut boards, being on 24/7 call. to make sure the operation is running near 100% at all time.
- Timing the cycles right: (speed at which the hash rate moves, btc price, fluctuation of the price of HW)

### The plan: (TL;DR)
**Short term** (2022 - learning period)
- Operate with shipping like strategies (lean, mind the cycles, etc)
- Buy new equpiment with gains, to outcompete rising hashrate difficulty

**Mid term** (2023 - scaling period)
- Sell VC's on a "innovative clean energy crypto revolution" for the utopian future. ("pipe-dream" or is it?)
- Use financial venture capital money to "gear" initial founder investment with promise of reasonable APY and braging rights to being hip and cool
- Get cheap bank loans to match investment

**Long term** (2024 - stock market listing period)
- Buy powerstation assets in Norway with NO/EU free renewable grants / funds. Sell it when it all go tits up ^^
- Innovate the funding model for even cheaper capital, ICO, Connect wallet and lockup crypto for instant APY, crowd funding with tokens, etc
- Diversify crypto mining portfolio outside btc, chia? other intense data crunching tasks?

### Cost of mining (naive overview):
- **Hardware 70%** (mining, cooling-hw / shipping / import tax)
- **Power: 20%**
- Mining pool fee 1%
- Infrastructure 3% (rig, warehouse-rent, vents)
- Insurance 2% (accident, theft, other)
- Staff: 1%
- Admin: 1% (gov reporting, accounting)
- Misc: 2% (operation, legal, development, reporting, research, consulting, analytics, presenation work, google ads, dev-cost, design cost, other)

#### insightful quotes:
- "AlpEreum popped up near a hydro-electric dam in central Switzerland. It found it could not compete with mines in China, Iceland and the US."
- "But this rising calculating power also caused mining difficulty to skyrocket—from January 2013 to January 2014, it increased one thousandfold—which forced miners to expand even faster."
- ⭐⭐⭐important⭐⭐⭐ "Bitcoin miners were now caught in the same vicious cycle that real miners confront—except on a much more accelerated timeframe. To maintain their output, miners had to buy more servers, or upgrade to the more powerful servers, but the new calculating power simply boosted the solution difficulty even more quickly. In effect, your mine was becoming outdated as soon as you launched it, and the only hope of moving forward profitably was to adopt a kind of perpetual scale-up: Your existing mine had to be large enough to pay for your next, larger mine. Many miners responded by gathering into vast collectives, pooling their calculating resources and sharing the bitcoin rewards. Others shifted away from mining to hosting facilities for other miners. But whether you were mining or hosting, mining entered “a scaling race,” says Carlson, whose own operations marched steadily from 250 kilowatts to 1.5 megawatts to 5 megawatts. And it was a race: Any delay in getting your machines installed and mining simply meant you’d be coming on line when the coins were even harder to mine."
- "Just when it seemed that things couldn’t get any worse, they did. As mining costs were rising, bitcoin prices began to dive. The cryptocurrency was getting hammered by a string of scams, thefts and regulatory bans, along with a lot of infighting among the mining community over things like optimal block size. Through 2015, bitcoin prices hovered in the low hundreds. Margins grew so thin—and, in fact, occasionally went negative—that miners had to spend their coins as soon as they mined them to pay their power bills. Things eventually got so grim that Carlson had to dig into his precious reserves and liquidate “all my little stacks of bitcoin,” he recalls, ruefully. “To save the business, we sold it all.”"
-  "There were calls from China, where a recent government crackdown on cryptocurrency has miners trying to move operations as large as 200 megawatts to safer ground."
- “As more miners enter the sector, margins will likely shrink, particularly for new entrants, as long as the bitcoin price stays stagnant,” Fabiano added.
- “I think there’s going to come a time, in the not too distant future, where there are companies that have raised money, have machines on order and have not deployed them yet that are in a cash crunch,” said Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners.  “When that happens, you get some very interesting opportunities, because now you don’t have to integrate a company; you’re just acquiring their assets,” he added. To be sure, this is not bad news for the industry in the long term. More consolidation and competition will not only make the industry more mature but will also help usher in the age of more efficient mining operations and incentivize use of more renewable sources of power.
- "Along with new entrants, Chinese miners who exited the region have been coming back online outside of China and will continue to do so next year. This will add to the hashrate and consequently the difficulty of the network, according to April Luo, an institutional sales representative for Asia at BlockFi, "
- “mining difficulty will continue to increase and will exceed the previous all-time high next year, as miners continue to expand their operations, but also due to the increased efficiency of the latest generation of mining machines.” (CoinDesk is also a subsidiary of DCG.) In fact, some industry participants are calling for hashrate reaching within the range of 300-350 exahash/second (EH/s) by the end of next year, which will be 70%-100% higher compared to around 179 EH/s as of Dec. 14, according to data from analytics firm Glassnode. One such observer is Rob Chang, CEO of bitcoin miner Gryphon Mining, who thinks it’s possible for the hashrate to reach 300 EH/s by the end of 2022. Meanwhile, Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer of Bitfarms, expects the hashrate to be between 300 and 350 EH/s by the end of next year. Bekbau of Xive also anticipates the hashrate doubling in 2022. “If our top end scenario of 300 EH/s comes to pass, the effective doubling of the global hashrates would mean that mining rewards will be cut in half,” Gryphon’s Chang said.
As competition eats away at the high margins of the miners, companies that can keep their costs low and are able to operate with efficient machines will be the one that will survive and have a chance at thriving.
- “Miners with low costs and efficient machines will be best positioned while those operating older machines will feel the pinch more than others,” Chang added.
- New entrants have a harder time securing cheap access to these, due to a lack of connections and increased competition over resources.
- “We anticipate that the inexperienced players will be the ones to experience lower margins,” said Danni Zheng, vice president of crypto miner BIT Mining, citing costs like electricity and data center construction and maintenance.
- Miners like Argo Blockchain will strive for ultra-efficiency while growing their operations. Given increased competition, “we have to be smarter about how we grow,” said Argo Blockchain’s CEO Peter Wall.
- “I do think that we’re in this kind of super cycle that is different from previous cycles but we still have to keep our eye on the prize, which is being very efficient and having access to low-cost power,’’ Wall added.
- "As mining becomes more competitive, “energy-saving solutions would be a game-determining factor,” said Arthur Lee, founder and CEO of Saitech, an Eurasia-based, clean-energy driven digital asset mining operator."
- Gryphon’s Chang. “We are noticing that they are focusing more on the things institutional investors traditionally place a lot of emphasis on, which are namely: quality management, experienced execution and companies that act like blue chip organizations [established companies] as opposed to stock promoters,” he said.
- Another trend that is likely to grow among the miners is the shift towards structured financial products, as they increasingly try to lock in margins, generate additional income from their mined coins and hedge the rise in competitive landscape, according to BlockFi’s Luo.
- If the supply chain issues get resolved next year, the smaller and newer companies that are feeling the brunt of the challenges currently will be able to enter the industry swiftly and compete with the larger miners, said Jonathan Manzi, the CEO and co-founder of Beyond Protocol,
- Paul Prager, chairman and CEO of miner TeraWulf, said, “I think that the primary reason China sort of missed the ball here is because they couldn’t control it, and Bitcoin is all about transparency, democratic values and decentralization.” He also suggested that the U.S. has a great regulatory environment, a “rule of law” and large availability of power, which is attracting more miners to the country.
- ⭐priceless⭐ electricity is cheaper in other countries, but plent of mega miners here in the USA that are either making it work, or selling their investors a pipe dream that it will eventually make money someday.
- If you can't afford to keep up with the hash rate by expanding capacity to offset your losses to maintain a consistent rate of production then mining is only ever going to be a hobby.
- During our recent ATH run everyone was breaking out the S9s and L3+ units again because they were actually quite lucrative to run. But there's no way to know when those periods will happen.
- Start small and learn then expand.
### Halving:
- Every halving means that half the supply of bitcoin is released to miners. (historically increase in prices usually offset this loss of revenue)
- Dates it will happen: 2024,28,32 etc
- “Satoshi Nakamoto,” programmed the network to periodically—every 210,000 blocks, or once every four years or so—halve the number of bitcoins rewarded for each mined block. The first drop, from 50 coins to 25, came on November 28, 2012, which the faithful call “Halving Day.” (It has since halved again, to 12.5, and is expected to drop to 6.25 in June 2020.)
- https://www.deltecbank.com/2022/02/28/bitcoin-halving-2024/?locale=en#:~:text=A%20Bitcoin%20halving%20is%20when,next%20will%20occur%20in%202024.
- https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/bitcoin-halving-countdown/

### More miners adjustment solution: (research the effect of this more)
- ⭐⭐⭐IMPORTANT⭐⭐⭐ Nakamoto built the system to make the blocks themselves more difficult to mine as more computer power flows into the network. That is, as more miners join, or as existing miners buy more servers, or as the servers themselves get faster, the bitcoin network automatically adjusts the solution criteria so that finding those passwords requires proportionately more random guesses, and thus more computing power. These adjustments occur every 10 to 14 days, and are programmed to ensure that bitcoin blocks are mined no faster than one roughly every 10 minutes. The presumed rationale is that by forcing miners to commit more computing power, Nakamoto was making miners more invested in the long-term survival of the network.

### Gotchas:
- Predominantly hydra-power is used to mine. Most effective, and clean energy label is important to not get canceled by gov / popular opinion etc
- there are mining-hw fix video tutorials / courses online, made by chinese crypto miners.
- reddit/bitcoinmining doesnt have alot of activity. meaning its still a niche industry

### Industry insight:
- Bitmain recently said it is diversifying into artificial intelligence, basing these operations in Israel. (2018)
- Bitmain has been in the news recently about leaked plans to potentially raise billions in a Hong Kong public listing. (2018)
- Crypto is predominantly mined on hydro power. as its the cheapst source of power in the west.
- Many former miners moves into data hosting
- Used Shiping containers can be a cheap way to scale infrastructure
-  bitcoin asset accounts for 0.6 per cent of the world’s total energy consumption and burns more electricity annually than Norway
- Paraguay which has a 100% energy supply based on hydroelectric sources.
- in 2022:  as the delay in supply of new mining rigs starts to normalize and competition becomes more intense.
- Currently the miners are leaning toward using technology such as immersion cooling to boost the performance and lower the cost of mining without having to buy additional computers.
- China have effectively dropped to zero, down from a high of 75.53% of the world’s total bitcoin mining hashrate in September 2019.
- In liquid immersion cooling, which is an alternative to traditional air-cooling systems, mining machines are fully immersed in a synthetic hydrocarbon compound liquid that has no electrical conductivity and is fully biodegradable. The specialized liquid can reduce heat, power consumption and noise stemming from the computers as well as prolong the lifespan of the machines, allowing miners to maximize profit. it plans to increase mining hashrate up to 50%, 180 liquid-filled tanks, with each tank holding 33 units of the Antminer S19j Pro mining machines: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/19/how-riot-plans-to-add-hashrate-without-adding-miners/
- According to recent research, Bitcoin mining is a highly concentrated business, with 10% of bitcoin miners controlling 90% of mining capacity on Bitcoin's network.
- Now that the Bitcoin ASIC design space has caught up to Moore’s Law,17 however, the design cycle
has slowed down significantly. As shown in Figure 5, Bitmain has labored to advance its Antminer
at the same rate as in the past.
- While considered a risky, volatile but highly profitable business today, we believe mining should
evolve to resemble the traditional commodities industry over the long term. ASIC lifecycles will
be long enough that industrial miners will have far greater predictability on their cash flows. In
a mature derivatives market, miners will be also be able to hedge against bitcoin’s volatility risk,
ensuring sufficient cash flows to fund ongoing operations. The greater predictability will attract
a new pool of risk averse players with large sums of capital. These players will further capitalize
on the second and third order opportunities mining presents. One such example is its usefulness
in smoothening peak and trough power demands. While many power plants tend to only run
during times of peak energy demand, Bitcoin mining provides incentives to operate year round.65
Ultimately, deeper capital markets, longer hardware cycles, lower than expected thresholds to
profitability, and dampened price volatility should provide significant opportunities to unlock an
unprecedented demand to mine bitcoin.
- In times of geopolitical uncertainty and financial market volatility, converting electricity into a
monetary asset could take on new importance. We believe Bitcoin is a call option on a global
digital monetary system and a hedge against existing regimes, potentially undermining the dollar
as the world’s reserve currency. Bitcoin mining could be the ultimate path to direct exposure to
this new monetary world order

### Pros:
- Rare combinations of founders. 3 headed dragon: 3 people with needed Skillset to operate, startup-finance, innovate
- Low complexity relative to other business
- Scaling adds little complexity
- Low downside for early founders if financed with financial alchemy ("gearing")
- ⭐Important⭐ Building a mining company with startup financing alchemy is like buying bitcoin with a huge discount. You keep all the upside and little of the downside. Even if you never make a profit mining bitcoin. you keep the invested money. The job is to sell the dream of an innovative clean energy crypto future in Norway. Not to prove that you can outcompete industry.
- A strategy from shipping is to buy HW in the right hype cycles. This can be utilized in crypto mining if executed dilligently.
- Hardware sourcing volatility will flatten as asci miners has cought up to moores law. No one entity will have exclusive access to unprecedented advantage. And manufactures wont have a leg up using their own HW, because manufacturing and mining are two different skillsets.

### Cons:
- The most competitive business in the world (previously your competing against trailerpark rednecks with no degree, now your increasingly competing with venture capital money and sophisticated operations wich are looking to get any legup they can, the future is probably having your own chip manufacture and research facility)
- High political volatility
- Sourcing hardware is at the mercy of mining manufacuring firms
- At the current time, mining bitcoin is a semi profitable epoch. These have come and gone, foricng miners to operate on thin margins until next profitable cycle begins, hopefully you have reinvested in the latest hardware as time moves forward.
- the sudden crackdown in china might be the reason for the current profitable period. When/if the chinese miners resurface other places in the world, it might bounce back to lower margins.
- scale isn't always a competitive advantage, as bitcoin favour decentralized miners, since smaller rigs can adopt faster than bigger rigs.
- At the end of the day, its a Yolo business. Your at mercy of many factors that cant be fully acccounted for. Invest time / resources accordingly. Its not going to make you  equpied for other proffesions in the future. If you invest little, and it doesnt occupy all your time it can be okay. If it occupies all your time. Take proffits as you go along. It can flip and you can be left with nothing. Doubling down if shit hits the fan has proven to be a bad decision historically in this industry.
- The mining math doesnt add up (unless you scale up and down and hite the good cycles): https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/t9bvyf/why_you_cant_making_money_mining_s19j_pro_miners/
- Big miners get big discounts? Making life for tiny miners hard. (research this)
- If you enter at the worng time in a bitcoin mining cycle, it can get difficult. most people enter after they hear success stories from other miners etc.

### Dangers
- ⭐important⭐ most forecasts are saying a double in hash rate by the end of 2022 (~7-8% increase / month). This increase is clearly diminishing your returns and depreciating your equipment. This is concerning because it will always tighten margins. But if you purchase 10 S19j Pros you will have 1040th, after one month if you reinvest the returns in another s19j pro you have just increased your hash rate by 10%. You will always be ahead of the game. Companies work similar in borrowing money to invest in capital for growth, if they don't opt to do that, they lower their value and lose their spot in the market.
- Chip shortages can increase price of sourcing hardware
- Politically toxic field to operate in, hw landfils, power consumption, crypto has bad rep
- Hardware manufactures are not the most relible
- Unlikley but possible: Bitcoin can switch to POS or other Proof mechanism due to unsustainable conditions for POW. rendering POW dead in the water. The green movment could kill it, or war, or overpopulation, poverty, political etc. (e-waste problem)
- Bitcoin price crashes, the mining pools start to operate on near loss creating a race to the bottom condition
- Bitcoin ice-age can last longer than a mining business can stay in business
- Countries can ban mining, like china. No one has sympathy for miners, so its an easy political decision to get through. popular with socialist like green parties. Political parties can say. we dont ban mining we just ban POW mining. People wont understand the difference. and wont make much fuss.
- cryptocurrency mining will absorb a lot more energy that could threaten national and international climate targets
- supply chain, chip shortage
- a problem with miners is that they are priced based on the hype.

### Power sourcing:
- Curtailed electricity can be a strategy to get bellow cost electricity. Basically buy when there is surplus energy in the grid etc
- So what lever can you pull to control electrical infrastructure? This is completely in your power and is what gives the big players competitive advantage through economies of scale. First finding infrastructure capable to support significant base loads can be a challenge in itself, and the rent price can boost your all in c/kwh significantly. Second, If you are a large enough operation it becomes more and more complex with energy trading, supply agreements, PPA's, etc.
-  Buying your own power plant: Sell electricity to the grid, it is a safer asset with better borrowing potential, and you can look to government grants and incentives in renewables.

### Hardware:
- antminer s19XP ($10,455) has alot of resources and shared knowledge online, for fixes and debugging etc
- numiner 440 is probably the future
- intel is will probably succeed the numiner
- ⭐IMPORTANT⭐ Intel's (bonanza) BMZ2 pricing has already been non-officially disclosed as going for $5,625 per miner, with performance rated at 135 TH/s with an energy efficiency of 26 J/THs. source: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intels-bitcoin-chips-double-cryptomining-specialists-hash-power
-  while you are waiting on the BZ2 which will be tough to get and at a premium, you could be hashing away at 110-115/th with the most proven ASIC on the planet. Your call. Sit and wait and mine nothing. OR buy the S19 and start hashing.

- immersion cooling: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/t4o9cf/immersion_cooling/

### Financial calculation:
- ⭐important⭐: ROI calculator: https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc
- bitcoin mine vs. purchase calculator spreadsheet https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-decision-to-mine-or-purchase-bitcoin
- Hash rate graph: https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate
- ⭐important⭐ The key control you have is determining if it is value add to sell equipment after 2-3 years and upgrade to the latest tech. It can be difficult to embed this within a financial model because it introduces a heap of other variables.
- Payback period of equipment - should be less than 1 year based on current profit rates. If you are paying more you challenge scaleability which will counter difficulty increase.
- Efficiency - with margins bound to tighten this year and next year, running the most efficient equipment will be a huge competitive advantage. Old equipment will retire first.
- Adding Other technologies - Increase in hashrate does not always need to come from more miners. e.g. you could have 8 S19j pros and instead of ordering another one you purchase an ⭐immersion cooler⭐. Not only would this provide ~30% hash rate, but it also provides flexibility if margins tighten to reduce energy output by ~20% for stock hash rate..
- WHERE in the cycle you are entering. Are you coming in early in the current generation of hardware or late in the current generation. In the former situation, your period to ROI should be longer period of profitability after reaching ROI will likely be longer before your hash power is eclipsed by the next generation of ASICs.
- A strategy is to hold when prices are low, sell when prices are high. provided you have the means to stay afloat, and pay recurring bills

### Fundraising:

### Mining pool gotchas:
- Proportional Mining: In a proportional mining payout method, miners receive rewards proportional to the amount of effort expended by them in finding a block. The payout amount also depends on whether the pool finds a block. Thus, miners will not earn anything unless they find a block. In the opposite scenario, they stand to maximize their profits if they find multiple blocks. This payout method is profitable during times when the price of bitcoin surges. Even though the difficulty level increases correspondingly, the payout from rising prices of bitcoin will ensure that the miner profits.
- Pay-Per-Share Method: As its name denotes, the pay-per-share method distributes payouts based on the mining power of the entire pool. It is the opposite of a proportional mining system. A miner’s share is determined not by their effort but by an equitable division of the rewards received by the pool. A miner receives their reward regardless of whether the pool finds a block. Since it guarantees a flat fee, this payment model is best suited for periods when bitcoin price is low because it translates to sustained income for miners during lean times.
- many miners have taken to switching their resources between mining pools based on their payout method and bitcoin price. Some mining pools have also adapted their rewards strategy between the two payout methods in response to declining rewards of bitcoin.
