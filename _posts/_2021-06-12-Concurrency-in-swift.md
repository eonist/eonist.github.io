My notes on making things async in swift <!--more-->

### DispatchQueue
- Call items async or sync
- Create dependencies with callbacks
- Call things on the main thread or in background thread

### DispatchGroup:
- Launch many operations async or serial and attach a completionBlock when they all complete
- If one operation fail, you have to call .leave. or else complete is never called, you can use .wait for group timeout

### DispatchWorkItem
- Ability to cancel many tasks in the queue
- Simpler than NsOperationQueue
- Can be built for Search trotting functionality for instance
// üèÄ

### NSOperationQueue
- More complex than DispatchWorkItem (can be a good idea to start with DispatchWorkItem before advancing to NSOperation)
- Ability to cancel single or all operations in a queue
- Ability to make one operation dependant on the completion of another
- Ability to override and create subclasses
- More control over different states the items has
- Can set priorities and assign different queues
- Can nest Operation queues in a multi-dimensional structure
- Can run one task after the previous finished etc (or all at the same time)

### Concurrent perform:
- Great for managing many small cpu intensive tasks, and dividing tasks efficiently to threads
- Can be used for async network calls if semaphore is used
- Can be used with AtomicValue (thread-safe variable) (see ParallelLoop project)
- Can do Any combination of: sync, async, concurrent, serial

### Semaphores:
- Semaphores has the ability to convert-a-callback based method into a returning-style-method. ‚ú®
- Semaphores also has the ability to timeout similarly to `dispatchgroup`
