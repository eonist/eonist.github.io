When you call needsDisplay = true, every NSView that has been added gets called from The first added to the last. The implications of this is that you shouldn't put heavy calculations within the drawRect closures.<!--more-->  But rather setup cached variables that the graphics reads from. Also from apples docs: "Although Cocoa windows can manage a relatively large number of views (around one hundred) without suffering noticeable performance problems"
