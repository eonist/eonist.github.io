My notes on culture vs strategy<!--more-->

When it comes to improving collaboration within an organization, the strategy approach is often unsuccessful. Despite being costly, culture is a more effective means of achieving this goal. Countless billion-dollar companies have attempted to implement team collaboration schemes, which are highly intricate but ultimately end up wasting everyone's time and feeling more like prisons than anything else. Culture, on the other hand, is straightforward: focus on making work enjoyable. Providing things like ping pong tables, abundant perks, and few constraints, while surrounding employees with amazing colleagues who are doing amazing things, will result in a happy workplace.


The text before GPT:

```
The strategy approach to improve organisational collaboration never works. Culture is always more efficient, even if it's expensive. Every billion dollar company has tried these "foster team collaboration schemes". They are brilliant, brilliantly complex and just end up wasting everyones time, becoming prisons instead of liberators. Culture is simple, just make work awesome. Ping pong tables, endless perks, near zero constraints, just awesome people doing awesome things, happy days.
