If you choose to work with context in the drawRect call, make sure you draw and fill in the call. Or else the CGContext gets confused which NSView it belongs to.<!--more-->  If you draw and fill outside of the drawRect call the drawing actually happens on the parent NSView. This makes using the "decorator-design-pattern" impossible with NSView. Since you need to be inside the drawRect call if you want clear the view on every redraw.
