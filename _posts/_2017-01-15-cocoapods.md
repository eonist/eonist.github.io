How to Use CocoaPods with Swift <!--more--> 

Installing a pod: 

0. Instal CocoaPod terminal `sudo gem install cocoapods`
1. Terminal `cd path/to/your/xcodeporject/` hit enter
2. Terminal `pod init` (This creates a Podfile for your project.)
3. Open the podFile Terminal: `open -a Xcode Podfile`
4. In order to use CocoaPods written in Swift, you must explicitly include `use_frameworks!`` to opt into using frameworks. 
5. Add pod `'Alamofire', '4.4.0'` after `use_frameworks`
6. open the project with the .xcworkspace file and not the .xcodeproj, otherwise you‚Äôll encounter build errors.


### Putting your own name on it:

```
target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'Alamofire', '~> 4.7'
end
```


### Terminal tricks
- pwd = show path (print working directory)
- ls -al üëâ Show files in folder
### Semantic versioning 
The three numbers are defined as major, minor, and patch version numbers. For example, the version number 0.9.0 would be interpreted as:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| major | When the major number is increased, this means that non-backwards compatible changes were introduced. When you upgrade a pod to the next major version, you may need to fix build errors, or the pod may behave differently than before. |
| minor | When the minor number is increased, this means new functionality was added, but it‚Äôs backwards compatible. When you decide to upgrade, you may or may not need the new functionality, but it shouldn‚Äôt cause any build errors or change existing behavior. |
| patch | When the patch number is increased, this means bug fixes were added, but no new functionality was added or behavior changes made. In general, you always want to upgrade patch versions as soon as possible to have the latest, stable version of the pod. |

‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏èIf a version number is less than 1.0.0, it‚Äôs considered to be a beta version, and minor number increases may include backwards incompatible changes.‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è

### This is a good primer:

CocoaPods has its benefits but I feel Carthage is less intrusive and SPM is the future so I settled on just knowing how CocoaPods work and rather use Carthage and SPM on a daily basis.
