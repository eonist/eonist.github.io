New website, new opportunities. The plan is to write about topics regarding security, privacy and making a sustainable startup. <!--more-->Especially the exciting things about building a startup, like how we are making things with our bare hands. How we come up with concepts and validate if they are worth pursuing or not, always keeping an eye on how precious few resources and time we have.

## The 80 / 20 rule
Because it's super easy to get busy and work on something. But we constantly ask ourselves every day, could we work on something else that has more punch for less time and resources spent. Now some rabbit holes are worth diving headfirst into, even though they don't materialize into anything, there is no "20 / 80" rule without the 80 so to speak. But questioning and getting as much feedback as you can are vital tools for staying on point. So follow our little startup journey, it's going to be fun.
