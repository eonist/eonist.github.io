My notes on how to make a responsive landing page. <!--more-->

### The concept
- The idea is to make each page make up the size of your macbook / iPhone screen like in the example bellow
- The key to building a responsive webpage is to strip to down to the bare essentials, make sure that works in both mobile and desktop, then add content.
- Try to only work with divisions with background colors in the beginning. Nail this. Then fiddle with image, and text later, which can get finicky

## Iterate forward
- Start by defining your content in text. (Use atom and markdown to structure things)
- Then start with index.html and style.css and reset.css (Code in Atom.io and preview in safari)
- Begin to align dummy color boxes to how your end result will be (logos, menues, content etc)
- Add headers and footers and content elements. import other css files for each module etc. Composability is key
- Slowly add text and menues and images
- then start to add design elements and refine sizes etc.
- build out the subpages
- once you have the basic html and css up and running you can start to reuse elements in a cms like Jekyll
