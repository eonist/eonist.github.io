### The problem
- There are a lot of awesome web-tech out there. But often they are overkill for simple sites
- Fancy sites are often expensive to maintain and un-secure because they rely on many dependencies
- One click websites, that are easy to setup, but often hard/expensive to customise. Wordpress isn't easy or cheap.
- Custom websites often struggle when traffic spikes, during a product launch etc.

### The solution
- Make something that is free
- Make something that is 100% secure
- Make something that can be maintained/upgraded cheaply
- Handles traffic spikes with-out hick-ups
