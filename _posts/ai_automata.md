Essay Draft Outline: AI Automata and the Rise of Hard Assets in a Hyperbitcoinization Future
I. Introduction

Thesis Statement: The increasing automation and dominance of AI in the workforce will dramatically reshape societal structures, leading to a world where hard assets become the ultimate store of value. This will create a divide between those who control such assets and the disenfranchised, culminating in hyperbitcoinization and asset-owner enclaves.
Context: Overview of AI development, the decline in human labor demand, and the rise of asset ownership as a key determinant of wealth and power.
II. AI Automation: The Catalyst for Change

AI Automata's Impact on Labor:
How advancements in AI and robotics reduce the need for human labor across industries.
Examples of industries where AI will replace significant human labor (manufacturing, logistics, customer service).
Useful vs. Useless Class:
Expanding on Yuval Noah Harari's concept of the "useless class," and the emergence of an economically redundant population.
Increasing socioeconomic stratification where the "useful" (those who own assets or control AI) become further distanced from the "useless" majority.
III. Hard Assets: The New Global Currency

Hard Assets as King:
With AI rendering human labor redundant, hard assets (such as real estate, gold, commodities, and especially Bitcoin) become the only reliable stores of value.
Historical precedence for hard assets becoming more valuable in times of uncertainty and rapid technological shifts (refer to examples like gold during financial crises).
Why Hard Assets?:
Inflationary pressures on fiat currency due to AI-driven unemployment.
Declining importance of human capital—leading to a focus on physical and digital assets.
IV. Attack on Hard Assets

Tensions Between the Useless and Asset Owners:
Widening economic inequality sparks social unrest and government intervention targeting asset holders.
Discuss possible attacks on wealth through taxation, expropriation, or social upheaval.
Mention potential regulatory attacks on cryptocurrencies or physical property as governments try to control wealth distribution.
Financial and Political Consequences:
The destabilization of fiat economies as people lose faith in traditional financial systems.
Rising demand for decentralized hard assets (Bitcoin) as safe havens for wealth.
V. Hyperbitcoinization: A Global Shift

What is Hyperbitcoinization?:
Definition and exploration of the concept where Bitcoin becomes the dominant global reserve currency.
Drivers of hyperbitcoinization: mistrust in fiat, growing inequality, and AI-driven unemployment.
Bitcoin as a Safe Haven:
Bitcoin’s decentralization and resistance to government control make it the ultimate hard asset in this scenario.
The deflationary nature of Bitcoin and its increasing adoption by those seeking to preserve wealth.
VI. Enclaves for Asset Owners

Separation of Society:
The physical and digital formation of enclaves where asset owners congregate, securing their wealth and privileges.
Examples from history where wealth holders isolated themselves from broader societal unrest (gated communities, private cities).
Possible emergence of Bitcoin citadels—physical communities built around the cryptocurrency and its holders.
AI-Driven Isolation:
How AI may also power these enclaves, from automated security to self-sustaining systems, reducing the need for external dependence.
The moral and ethical implications of an isolated elite controlling AI and wealth while the majority struggles.
VII. Ethical and Societal Implications

Moral Dilemmas:
The ethical consequences of a world divided by asset ownership and AI-driven labor displacement.
How this future challenges traditional notions of human worth, productivity, and equality.
Potential Reforms or Alternatives:
Could universal basic income (UBI) or redistribution prevent the rise of hyperbitcoinization and asset-owner enclaves?
Proposals for integrating AI into society in a more equitable way, reducing the focus on hard assets as power.
VIII. Conclusion

Restating the Thesis: As AI automata take over the workforce, hard assets will become the ultimate currency of power, leading to societal division and hyperbitcoinization. This process will reshape the global economy, isolating asset owners while disenfranchising the majority.
Final Thoughts: Whether this future is inevitable or avoidable depends on how society chooses to adapt to the new economic realities AI and automation present.
