My notes on DispatchGroup <!--more--> 

### DispatchGroup:
Dispatch groups must enter and leave inside async calls on the bg thread. and must have the same amount of enter and leaves. 
I suppose one could pass dispatch group refs as a variable and use it in a nested scenario. But DispatchGroups seems to work best when wanting to do many async tasks on bg thread at the same time and have one onComplete for when all tasks complete. 

```swift

import Foundation
@testable import Utils

//do 3 things async, 
//then in each 3 things do 2 things async but do something on main-thread when these 4 things are all finished

class ASyncTest {
    var bg = {return DispatchQueue.global(qos: DispatchQoS.QoSClass.background)}()/*Convenience*/
	var main = {return DispatchQueue.main}()/*Convenience*/
    /**
     * Next implement the bellow in your example:
     * TODO: Also research blocks
     */
    init(){
            let group = DispatchGroup()
            
            group.enter()
            bg.async{/*do 2 things at the same time*/
                Swift.print("do default")
                sleep(IntParser.random(3, 6).uint32)/*simulates task that takes between 1 and 6 secs*/
                group.leave()
            }
            if("" != ""){
                group.enter()
                bg.async{/*do 2 things at the same time*/
                    Swift.print("do the first")
                    sleep(IntParser.random(2, 7).uint32)/*simulates task that takes between 1 and 6 secs*/
                    group.leave()
                }
            }else{
                Swift.print("do the second")
            }
            
            //group.wait()/*wait blocks main thread*/
            group.notify(queue: main, execute: {/*you have to jump back on main thread to call things on main thread as this scope is still on bg thread*/
                    Swift.print("üèÅ group completed: üèÅ")//make a method on mainThread and call that instead.
            })
    }
}


```


## DispatchGroup and DispatchWorkItem

A must if you also need to cancel your async tasks: [https://www.raywenderlich.com/148515/grand-central-dispatch-tutorial-swift-3-part-2](https://www.raywenderlich.com/148515/grand-central-dispatch-tutorial-swift-3-part-2)
