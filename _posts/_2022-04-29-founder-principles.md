Notes on founder attributes<!--more-->

**Grit**
Grit involves the passion and perseverance to achieve long-term and meaningful goals, as well as the ability to persist in something you feel passionate about and to persevere when faced with obstacles. Grit is also about perseverance, which means sticking with it and continuing to work hard even after experiencing difficulty or failure.

**Drive**  
Drive is a planned effort to achieve something, while motivation is defined as "the willingness to do something, or something that causes willingness." Although both words are goal-oriented, they have significant differences in meaning.

**Spike**  
To demonstrate a spike, a founder should show talent and focus on one or two main interests. This can help differentiate them from others and provide a unique value proposition.
