My notes on Interface Builder for iOS <!--more-->

### Vector assets
- You can use vector graphics but you have to use .pdf since ios has no support for xml or svg. You add .pdf assets by draging them into the assets.casette
- Supposedly you can add an svg to a left bar nav button. But scaling it becomes a problem. More research needed.
