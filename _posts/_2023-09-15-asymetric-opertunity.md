My notes on asymetric oppertunities<!--more-->

- Chase asymetric oppertunities
- Make sure you don't become a commodity
- The commodity game is a race to the bottom

Asymetric leverage. If you look at all successful companies ever, you will see that in the begining they had some for of asymetric leverage. a team, a market opertunity, a position that compounded etc etc

Validate to find asymetric opertuneties. Make interesting positions,

The market is a web of bubbles. If you only chase small bubbles you will lose.
Try to find a place in the web of bubbles where you can grow.

If you invest enough into an asymetric opertunity. You can ride that for a long time. Even create tremendous value, that can fund new asymetric opertunities later.

But you have to carve out the invest in the first place. Time or money. And that is the challange. Also of course mapping out the asymetry. But that anyone can do. And then leverage that mapping to get time and money. To pursue the asymetry.
