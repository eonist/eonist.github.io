In Swift, the choice between using a struct and a tuple depends on the context and how you plan to use the data. Here's a summary of when to use each:

- **Use a struct when:**
 - You need to group related data together. Structs are ideal for creating custom data types that encapsulate related properties and behaviors.
 - You want to add methods or computed properties to your data. Structs can have methods and computed properties, which can be very useful for encapsulating logic related to the data.
 - You need to extend the data type with additional functionality. Structs can conform to protocols, which allows you to extend their functionality.
 - You want to create instances of the data type. Structs are value types, which means each instance has its own copy of the data. This is useful when you want to work with independent copies of the data.

- **Use a tuple when:**
 - You need to group together a few values for temporary use, such as returning multiple values from a function. Tuples are great for one-off use cases where you don't need to define a custom type.
 - You want to return multiple values from a function without defining a custom type. Tuples are perfect for this because they can hold multiple values of different types.
 - You don't need to add methods or computed properties to your data. Tuples are simple and straightforward for grouping values without the overhead of defining a struct.

In summary, use a struct when you need a custom data type with methods, computed properties, or when you want to extend the type with protocols. Use a tuple for temporary grouping of values without the need for a custom type. Structs are more suitable for complex data models and when you need to encapsulate behavior, while tuples are best for simple, temporary data grouping [1][4].
