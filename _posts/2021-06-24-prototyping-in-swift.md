My notes on prototyping applications in swift<!--more-->

### Introduction:
- Creating a modern iOS app can be a daunting task. You need to implement features like Dark Mode and support multiple screen sizes and iOS versions, as well as multiple languages. It's easy for things to quickly get out of hand.
- Modernizing legacy apps with spaghetti code can be even more challenging.
- That's why it's smart to start with a prototype in code, whether you're building a new app or upgrading an existing one. By starting from scratch, you can build a solid foundation and add more complex code on top later. You'll also have everything fresh in your mind, allowing you to move quickly when implementing more complex functionality.

### Problem:
- Building a complex iOS app can seem daunting, with many requirements and high expectations, but limited time and resources.

### Solution:
- Start by building a mock app with fake data and graphics, focusing on how the app works rather than complex APIs.
- Focus on getting the spacing and interactions right, starting with the simplest elements like squares with color and gradually adding text and UI elements.
- Once you're happy with how the app feels, start adding more complex logic and APIs, covering side effects as you go.
- Another approach is to build small modules of the app first, nurturing them to fruition individually before integrating them into the main app. This way, you can ensure that each part is awesome before combining them into a sum that is also awesome.
- Starting with a blank canvas and new drawing sticks can be more motivating than trying to work with an existing codebase.
- By taking these steps, you can build a solid foundation for your app and gradually add more complex functionality, making the process less daunting and more manageable.
