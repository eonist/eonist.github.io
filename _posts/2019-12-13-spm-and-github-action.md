My notes on using swift package manager and Github actions together<!--more-->

## Adding SPM unit-test to github actions:

1. Terminal: in project-path: `Swift package init`
2. Make xCode project
3. Add unit-test target in XCode name it: `SomeTest`
4. Drag `/Tests` folder into xCode top level of file-sidemenu (you created Tests/ via SPM)
5. Move the `SomeTest` into Tests folder (you created this in xcode)
6. In the `test-target` build setting search for info.plist and edit the path to be `/Tests/SomeTest/`
7. make sure `swift build` and `swift test` in terminal works
7. push to github
8. in github/repo: actions -> swift action (change the name to Tests, so the badge makes sense later)
9. Now every time you push, the project is built and tested ðŸŽ‰

## Add a build badge:
**Code:**  
```markdown
![Swift](https://github.com/passbook/Key/workflows/Swift/badge.svg)
```
**Result:**   
![Swift](https://github.com/passbook/Key/workflows/Swift/badge.svg)

## Gotchas:
- TestTarget must have unique name if you use them as dependencies of other repos. Or else swift wont know which is correct ðŸ¤·, So name the TestTarget YourProjectName_OSName_Tests (drop the underscores)
- "Swift test" in terminal builds for macOS

## Example:

```swift
name: Swift

on:
  push:
     branches:
     - master
  schedule:
  - cron: "0 12 * * 0-6" #

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: macOS-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Build
      run: swift build -v
    - name: Run tests
      run: swift test -v
```


```yml
on:
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '*/15 * * * *'
