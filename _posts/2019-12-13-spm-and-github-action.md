My notes on using swift package manager and Github actions together<!--more-->

## Adding SPM unit-test to github actions:

1. Swift package init
2. Make xCode project
3. Add unit-test target
4. Drag /Tests folder into xCode file-pan
5. Move the test-target into Tests folder
6. In the test-target build setting search for info.plist and edit the path to be /Tests/SomeTest
7. make sure `swift build` and `swift test` in terminal works
7. push to github
8. in github/repo: actions -> swift action (change the name to Tests, so the badge makes sense later)
9. Now every time you push, the project is built and tested ðŸŽ‰

## Add a build badge:
**Code:**  
```markdown
[![Github actions badge](https://github.com/light-stream/Stream-lib/workflows/Builds/badge.svg)](https://github.com/light-stream/Stream-lib/actions)
```
**Result:**   
[![Github actions badge](https://github.com/light-stream/Stream-lib/workflows/Builds/badge.svg)](https://github.com/light-stream/Stream-lib/actions)

## Third party alternative build badge:
- Only works in public repos (were as github's own badge solution works on private repos)
**Code:**  
```markdown
[![Github actions badge](https://badgen.net/github/checks/light-stream/Stream-lib?icon=github&label=Build%20Status)](https://github.com/light-stream/Stream-lib/actions)
```
**Result:**  
[![Github actions badge](https://badgen.net/github/checks/light-stream/Stream-lib?icon=github&label=Build%20Status)](https://github.com/light-stream/Stream-lib/actions)

## Gotchas:
- TestTarget must have unique name if you use them as dependencies of other repos. Or else swift wont know which is correct ðŸ¤·, So name the TestTarget YourProjectName_OSName_Tests (drop the underscores)
- "Swift test" in terminal builds for macOS

## Example:

```swift
name: Swift

on:
  push:
     branches:
     - master
  schedule:
  - cron: "0 12 * * 0-6"

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: macOS-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Build
      run: swift build -v
    - name: Run tests
      run: swift test -v
```
