My notes on xCode cloud<!--more-->

- Now you can see your CI/CD system directly in Xcode.
- You can check your builds, change workflows, check which test failed and navigate directly to its source code.
- You can even see snapshots from your tests and rebuild branch.
- Now you just add Xcode Cloud to your project and it gets automatically access to all provisioning profiles and certificates. You can instantly build your project and release it to TestFlight and App Store.
- Once you set up Xcode Cloud, all your team members added to the project will automatically get access to see and run builds in Xcode. One place less to give & revoke access.

### Price
- 100 hours plan costs $44.99/month.
