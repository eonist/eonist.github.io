My notes on onboarding<!--more-->

**In general, the onboarding process aims to:**

- Educate users about the app's major functions.
- Collect information needed to create personalized content and experiences.

To create an effective onboarding experience, consider the following tips:

- Use concise language. After downloading the app, users want to explore it and see what it offers. If the onboarding experience is too wordy, it can be overwhelming and frustrating.
- Keep it short and sweet. People can lose interest if the onboarding process is too lengthy, so it's usually a good idea to limit it to about five pages. Additionally, use a page indicator or something similar to clearly show the onboarding progress and keep users informed.
- Focus on the most important features. With a limited number of pages, it's critical to highlight the most important functions or benefits of your app. Leave out trivial details for the user's own exploration later. After the onboarding, users should have an overall intuitive impression of the app.
- Allow users to skip certain customization settings. For some content-providing apps, such as reading or music streaming apps, it's beneficial to offer customized content. However, many users don't like to answer a series of questions about their own behavior. So, it's important to include a skip button that allows users to skip all these settings.
