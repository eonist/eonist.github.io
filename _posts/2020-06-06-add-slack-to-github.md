My notes on adding github repo or organisation activities to a slack channel<!--more-->

First, open Slack, and select the channel where you want to receive GitHub notifications. Click on the gear icon next to the channel name, then select “Add apps.” From there, search for “GitHub” in the search bar, then select “Add to Slack.”

### Setup
1. In a slack channel named `dev` write: `/github subscribe name-of-org name-of-repo`
2. Click a few yes, confirm, enter password
3. 🎉 Now you get all activities from github right into a slack channel

### Pro tip:
- Uninstall `/github unsubscribe name-of-org name-of-repo`
- For other cool github integrations: `/github help`
