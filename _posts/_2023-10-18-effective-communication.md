My notes on effective communication<!--more-->

Presenting something effectively. When communicating with customers or users, it's important to follow a certain structure, be it a website an article or starting a discussion.

1. Empathise with the user by discussing a problem they may have or something that affects them personally. This will help them feel more engaged. "The hock"

2. Dive deeper into the details of the topic now that the user is engaged. "Drilling down into details"

3. Explain how this information can be useful for them in their lives. This will make the user feel good about the information they just received and encourage them to consider it further. It's all about creating an "aha" moment and indirectly selling the idea. "The aha moment" followed by the ask / call to action.
