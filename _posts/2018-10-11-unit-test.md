My notes on unit testing in Xcode<!--more-->

⚠️️ (This article is being updated in the coming days, with video and more advance case studies) ⚠️️

### Xcode unit testing
1. Under targets, add target, add unit test
2. In the `...Test/...Tests.swift` file inside the `testExample` method add `XCTAssertEqual("Hello, World!", "Hello, World!")`
3. Product -> Test (cmd+U) alternatively: right click the `...Tests.swift` and click: Run  ...Tests

## Pro
- Writing tests first gives us a clear perspective on the API design, by getting into the mindset of being a client of the API before it exists.
- Good tests serve as great documentation of expected behaviour.
- some tests for core functionality is good

## Con
- hard to pivot after many tests are written
- hard to reorg code
- high code coverage makes code bureaucratic

### RGR ( Red — Green — Refactor ) methodology
Red, Green and Refactor are stages of the TDD (Test Driven Development).

- Red: Write a small amount of test code usually no more than seven lines of code and watch it fail.
- Green: Write a small amount of production code. Again, usually no more than seven lines of code and make your test pass.
- Refactor: Tests are passing, you can make changes without worrying. Clean up your code.
