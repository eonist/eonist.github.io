[the swift source code for the app](https://github.com/stylekit/stash)   

## Ideas:
- left sidebar in translucent with open-source iconography
- Add this demo app to the stylekit Org account "Stash.app"
- Main content view should have a white background
- The list in the mainView needs to a custom list that extends List and then later RBSlider list 
- The custom list should override the mergeAt method and implement its own lable-Items 
- the custom Label item should have a header, date on the right side. and content
- when you click the label item you should go to the itemView. A back icon in the top left corner should take you back
- The app should read from a xml document with nodes for articles. article should have meta data and text content

## Tasks:  
- [x] Start by creating the black translucent window again. It should not have a titleBar or title buttons. 
- [x] Add your own title buttons: as you need custom locations for these
- [x] Try to add the white background for the mainView
- [x] Try to add semi transparent boxes in the left sidebar to test if this works
- [x] Find open-source icons Use helveticons for the first test, then find replacements later. 
- [ ] Maybe add gesture to get back to main content
- [ ] Add translucent window support from css. See tips on this here: http://stylekit.org/blog/2016/01/23/Chromeless-window/
