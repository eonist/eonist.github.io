A few workflows concerning Carthage and nested framework <!--more--> 

⚠️**PRE-REQUISITES:**⚠️️ In your github repo you need to include .xcodeproj file with framework settings all setup. The settings should also include:   

1. Scheme is shared.   
2. testability set to YES under build settings.   
3. Build settings -> Framework search paths set to: ``$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build`` (Carthage generates aliases in this folder) aka magic   portals to other frameworks.   
4. ``.gitignore`` that excludes .framework files and other binaries (We should never have bins in repos)


## 1. The Automated workflow:

1. Create a repo on github named "A" (this will be the child)
2. Create a repo on github named "B" (this will be the parent to the child)
3. In repo "B" add a Cartfile with ``github "eonist/A" "master"`` 👈 Informs carthage to build this before anything else
4. On your local machine create a Cartfile and add ``github "eonist/B" "master"``
5. In terminal ``carthage update`` Now everything will download and be built in the right order. Children first 🔑
6. Drag and drop the .frameworks located in ``Carthage/Build/<Platform>/``

## 2. The Manual workflow:
1. include all the repos you want to use in a cartfile on your local machine 
2. In terminal Do ``carthage update --no-build`` (this downloads all repos but skips building)
3. Then do carthage build <name-of-repo> for each child dependency starting with the farthest descendants
4. When you have built your last item drag and drop the .frameworks located in ``Carthage/Build/<Platform>/``

## 3. Downloading prebuilt .framework files
If project owners include .framework files in their releases. (Some do, some don't) then using ``carthage update --no-build`` And the binaries will be placed in ``Carthage/Build/<Platform>/`` 

## 4. Using submodules: 
Don't do it, Google it if your not familiar with why you shouldn't use submodules for nesting dependencies or just read this article [https://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/why-your-company-shouldnt-use-git-submodules/](https://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/why-your-company-shouldnt-use-git-submodules/) or  [this](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/package-manager-fetch.html) That being said. Projects such as  [AlamoFireObjectMapper](https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/AlamofireObjectMapper) project do use submodules in conjunction with Carthage framework nesting. 


## Final notes: 

Which workflow is better? The future is automated so go with option 1. Also you need something that can work in a CI environment. The first workflow has a bit more bloat attached and carthage could have avoided this by allowing order take priority when building. (Feature request!!!) 👉 The optional workflows are written down in order to justify the extra contextual files one has to place in sub dependencies. 👈
