> IÂ think the way to solve this kind of problem is to solve it first for the most degenerate, simple case you can think of, and then add any desired refinements.

1. Sketch the design in a notepad (Desktop and mobile)
2. Make the design look gd in sketch or Figma
3. Make the index.html and .css to match the design, start simple, write a lot of comments in the code with gotchas, tweak in more advance styling as you move forward. You can align layout with flex styling, use google to find alignment solutions as you go. Html and css is not that hard, its almost the same as using indesign or pages. You just have to manually write the values, instead of using dails and knobs and buttons
4. Make desktop and mobile separate, combine after, it's too complex to begin both in the same file.
5. Jekyll can be used as static CMS, blog, subpages etc
6. Get feedback as you go, and iterate on the feedback

(Other solutions like wordpress, webflow etc are more or less the same process)
