> IÂ think the way to solve this kind of problem is to solve it first for the most degenerate, simple case you can think of, and then add any desired refinements.

1. Sketch the design on a notepad
2. Make the design look gd in sketch or figma
3. Make the index.html and .css to match the design, start simple, write alot of comments in the code with gotchas, tweak in more advance styling as you move forward. You can align layout with flex styling, use google to find alignment solutions as you go.
4. Make desktop and mobile separate, combine after, its too complex to begin both in the same file.
5. Jekyll can be used as static cms, blog etc
