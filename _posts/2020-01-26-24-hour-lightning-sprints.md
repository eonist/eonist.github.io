My notes on doing 24-hour lightning sprints<!--more-->

## Exploring problems
Take some time to sit down and think individually about problems that interest you. Spend about an hour on this step.

## Choosing problems
Write a sentence or two about each problem and choose around 10 problem statements that you like.

## Identifying blockers quickly
In any innovation, there are bound to be blockers. It's important to figure out the severity of these blockers as early as possible. Some blockers can be overcome, while others can leave your product dead in the water. In a 24-hour sprint, you won't have time to explore all blockers, so you'll need to use guesstimation and ignore some of them to make progress. However, be sure to add them to the project risk assessment section. This is why 24-hour sprints can be great - at least you won't waste more than 24 hours.

## Key considerations for your pitch deck
- Cost-benefit analysis to suggest a great use of time
- Clear and concise presentation of key points for great applications
- Avoid obfuscation of the idea, team, technology, and company status for weak applications
- Clarity of thought in presenting the idea
- Clearly identify who is building the product
