**The hazy look and feel** is a pointer to the use of translucency that OSX and IOS offer within modern UI (TranclucentSkin TM). The void like design is also a symbol that the StyleKit it self is just an empty framework. <!--more--> Its What you express with it that counts. The stylekit is just the enabler. The simplicity of the logo represents how simple it is to use it.

**Quick design idea for inspiration:**   
1. The helvetica neue thin works well.   
2. the shape works well.  
3. The feel of the color works well  
4. but its not there yet. ==Needs substance==, something you will remember, something related  
5. Take cue from Monocle magazine etc. Something Lab esque. Maybe stacked layers?   

**NOTE:** Contemplating changing the name from Element to StyleKit, stylekit resonates better with what it is. People get it, even if they dont, ==they may be tempted to check it out on the notion of what their subconscious think it is==. It also feels better to add a lib to your project that is named the same as what it is. Element feels like its own thing, not something you add. And people are reluctant to adding things to their precious projects. StyleKit also works well not only with apple products bit with android etc. Even if the suffix "kit" is usually an established apple naming convention. Do check if something of significant is named StyleKit as well. And spell check this paragraph!!  

**NOTE:** The current ElementExplorer.app could be renamed to StyleLab, and could even be its own project on github, ot could even just be called lab, implicitly put

**NOTE:** Future help documentation idea: StyleManual, simply Manual

- StyleKit is more identifiable on google. And people google what they have in their periferal view. Element will drop way down on google.
