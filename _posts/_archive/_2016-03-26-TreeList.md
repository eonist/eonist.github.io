## Notes:

## Tasks:
- [x] Create the TreeList Component
- [x] Debug the TreeList Component
- [x] ==Fix the grouping css styles. Check if they work first. They might.==
- [ ] Setup the Gitsync.io and add the articles (also forward the domain)
- [x] ~~Get the EMS working,~~ if its not already
- [x] fix the depth margin of the checkbox icon
- [ ] fix the hitArea offset problem. How was this solved before?
- [ ] Grouped css styles doesn't work if one style ha spaces. Fix this in an isolated test
- [x] The margin problem is pretty nested into the core, ~~as a quick fix you could use padding or offset~~. Then fix margin later
- [ ] Figure out how to combine generics, extension and Dictionary
- [ ] When you select items via TreeListModifier the xml isn't updated. Look into the setAttribute Node Event to fix this
- [ ] To support custom font attribs on selected items I think you need to implement :unSelected as a state. or do research into how other people solved this
