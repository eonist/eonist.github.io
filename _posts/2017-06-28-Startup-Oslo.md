"Kulturhuset" is a new place in the startup scene in Oslo. It's "free" and can be used by anyone to collaborate or work on different projects. <!--more-->  Wifi, seating and water is free. There is also a paid tier. Such as Coffee, beer, pingpong. It's smack in the center of Oslo and a short stroll from Grunerl√∏kka or St.Haugen. It's perfect for meetings with clients or hanging out on weekends. You can work there until 3AM but its pretty packed on Weekends. This is the place to go to if you want to meet like-minded designers/writers/developers/creatives etc. Its 23 years age cap after 19:00 but 20year olds can access if they are in a solid "state of mind"
