My notes on product development "Rock, Pebble, Sand" style<!--more-->

### The rock, pebble and the sand
The simple premiss is that you fill up a jar, first the rocks, then the pebbles, then the sand.

- The rocks, the big features, new products
- The pebble, the feature, the design tweaks
- The sand, the fixes, the adjustments, the minor tweaks

### Defining your roadmap Rock, pebble, sand style
- You need some rocks, but make sure you make room for pebbles and sand
- The rocks you ship now and then, every quarter, or every year etc.
- The pebbles you ship monthly
- The sand you deal with all the time, and ship everyday, every week at least.

### Unicorn Inc 1 year roadmap:

**Sand** (Everyday i'm hustling)

- Fix Facebook integration issue from corp account
- Caching issues see log
- Document the new module

### Why is this important?
- Because establishments have a tendency of only wanting rocks and pebbles, under emphasising the importance of the sand. Shipping sand doesn't look so good as shipping rocks or pebbles. But if you ignore the sand, soon enough you wont be able to add sand to the bottom or mid parts of the jar. As the pebbles will have clogged together and formed a seal. The only way to then get more sand in is to shake the jar. And that is expensive, the jar can crack, you sometimes have to take out everything and put it back in, which is time consuming. So the way to go about this is to add rocks, then pebbles, then sand. In equal amounts as time progress. Adding only rocks for as long as possible only creates a suboptimal product.
