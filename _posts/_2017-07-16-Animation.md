- In springing, acceleration is proportional to the distance. If the object is far away from the target, a whole lot of acceleration is applied, increasing the velocity quickly. As the object gets closer to its target, less acceleration is applied, but itâ€™s still accelerating! It flies right past the target, and then acceleration pulls it back. Eventually, friction causes it to settle down.
