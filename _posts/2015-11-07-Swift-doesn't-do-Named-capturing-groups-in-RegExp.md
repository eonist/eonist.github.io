But if you combine a swift enum with RegExp matches and add ($n ) to your capture groups you can simulate named capturing groups. <!--more--> 
```
Example will come soon
```
[from apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSRegularExpression_Class/)    

The text of capture group n will be substituted for $n. n must be >= 0 and not greater than the number of capture groups. A $ not followed by a digit has no special meaning, and will appear in the substitution text as itself, a $.

- [ ] try to get numbered capturing groups working. (You may need them for back referencing etc)
